# Introduction

Eating is one of life's greatest pleasures. In a perfect world, healthy and delicious food would be all around us. It would be easy to choose and easy to enjoy.

But of course it's not a perfect world. There are thousands of barriers that can keep us from eating in a way that nourishes our bodies and satisfies our tastes. Money just needn't be one of them.

Kitchen skill, not budget, is the key to great food. This cookbook is a celebration of the many delicious meals available to those on even the most strict of budgets.

Cooking on a limited budget is not easy, and there are times when a tough week can turn eating into a chore. I hope the recipes and techniques in this book help make those times rare and tough choices a little more bearable.

Learning to cook has a powerfully positive effect. My hope is that this book will empower people to become better, more conscious cooks, able to conjure deliciousness in any kitchen, anytime, anywhere. Good cooking alone can't solve hunger in America, but it can make life happier—and that is worth every effort.

## This Book

I created this book at the capstone project for my MA in Food Studies at New York University. After I posted a free PDF on my website, it went viral on Reddit, Tumblr, and elsewhere—almost 100,000 downloads in the first few weeks! All the supportive feedback gave me the courage to launch a Kickstarter campaign to get printed copies Good and Cheap into the hands of people who don't have computers or who wouldn't otherwise see it.

## About My Choices

These recipes are designed for the budget of people on SNAP (the US program that used to be called Food Stamps). The meals are generally healthy and use ingredients common to most low-income New York City neighborhoods. More than in most cookbooks, the recipes are flexible and encourage substitution based on availability, taste, and price. I want you to tailor things to your taste. That is the joy of cooking!

My intent was to create satisfying food that doesn't require you to supplement your meals with cheap carbohydrates to stave off hunger. I strove to create recipes that use money carefully, without being purely slavish to the bottom line. For example, many recipes use butter rather than oil. Butter is not cheap, but it creates flavor, crunch, and richness in a way that cheap oils never can.

To encourage people to eat fruits and vegetables, these recipes do not feature large amounts of meat. Many recipe collections created for Americans use meat as the central feature of most meals. My recipes celebrate the vegetables rather than the meat.

A few recipes call for fancy kitchen equipment, but in my work with low-income families in New York, I have found that items like blenders, food processors, and electric mixers are not as rare as you might think. I did not, however, attempt to tackle the very real situation of people who have no kitchen, no equipment, and no space to prepare food. I simply cannot hope to do those issues justice in the bounds of this project.

## A Note on Prices

The prices in this book come from two sources. The first is data I collected from four grocery stores in Inwood, a relatively low-income neighborhood on the north tip of Manhattan, where I surveyed prices for the pantry items on the opposite page. For non-pantry items like specific spices and a wider variety of fruits and vegetables, I consulted an online grocery store. Naturally, prices in other cities—even other neighborhoods—will vary, so please think of the numbers as a guideline.

## Pantry Basics

With these commonly available items in your pantry, you'll always have a wide variety of meals on the table within minutes. Keeping a well-stocked pantry is the key to easy, fast cooking at home. When you're living on a budget, building up supplies does take time, but just keep adding each week and you'll get there in time.

### Vegetables

Vegetables can (and should!) be the base of most meals. Other than greens, which should be used quickly, these can be stored for a few days to a few weeks. Try the new seasonal vegetables as they cycle through the markets and go on sale.

_Garlic, onions, carrots, celery, peppers, broccoli, tomatoes, hot peppers, hardy greens, salad greens, potatoes, sweet potatoes, cauliflower, winter squash_

### Fruits

Citrus fruits are cooking essentials and they keep well. The zest and juice can liven up just about any dish and they always make a great dressing. Bananas, apples and melons are great quick snacks, but try them all!

_Apples, melons, oranges, limes, lemons, bananas_

### Grains

There is great variety to be had in whole grains. Try new ones frequently, cooking based on the package instructions. You can substitute almost any of them for rice or toss them in a salad.

_Bread, tortillas, pasta, all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, oats, popcorn, short-grain rice, long-grain rice, brown rice, cornmeal, dried whole grains_

### Dairy

Butter is just as good to cook with as it is on toast.

_Butter, milk, yogurt, queso fresco, Romano or Parmesan, sharp cheddar, mozzarella_

### Protein

These items are easily stored, cheap, and have multiple uses. Whenever possible, buy your favorite meats fresh instead of frozen.

_Eggs, dried beans, lentils, tofu, nuts, peanut butter_

### Canned Vegetables

Well priced and essential for making sauces.

_Whole tomatoes, tomato paste, whole corn_

### Flavor and Cooking

You can explore an extraordinary number of cuisines with these items. They add depth and excitement to the most simple dishes.

_Olive oil or vegetable oil, wine vinegar, anchovies, sardines, olives, fish sauce, canned coconut milk, miso paste, mustard, soy sauce, chili sauce, fresh herbs, dried spices, brown sugar_

### Treats that Go a Long Way

Although these items can be expensive, a little goes a long way; when you can, pick up an item or two and enjoy the results.

_Dried fruits, dried mushrooms, frozen shrimp, maple syrup, bacon, prosciutto or pancetta, vanilla_

## Tips for Eating and Shopping Well

### Buy Foods that can Be Used in Multiple Meals

Versatile ingredients save meals. If you buy cornmeal, you can make polenta (p. 82), corn bread, and polenta fries (p. 46). If you buy yogurt (or make your own), you can have it with fruit (p. 22), make raita (p. 121) and tzatziki (p. 122), or use it in a drink (p. 110).

### Think Weekly

Each week, mix things up by buying different varieties of staple foods like grains and beans. This week, you might have oatmeal every morning (p. 12) with black bean chili or black bean tacos later in the day, but next week you'll have yogurt for breakfast and chana masala (p. 72) or hummus for lunch and dinner. If you have time to shop frequently, pick up smaller amounts of produce every couple of days to ensure everything is fresh. It's a lot more inspiring to pull crisp, vibrant greens out of the fridge than to unstick a wilted mess from the bottom of the veggie drawer.

### Start Building a Pantry

If possible—and admittedly this can be difficult for people living on their own—reserve part of your budget to buy one or two semi-expensive pantry items each week. Things like olive oil, soy sauce, and spices (p. 126) are pricey at first, but if you use just a little with each recipe, they go a long way. With turmeric, coriander, cumin, and fresh ginger, you'll suddenly you'll have a world of flavor on your shelf. Check out the next section for specific items to build your pantry.

### More Vegetables Means More Flavor

Nothing livens up a bowl of rice like summer squash and corn! Vegetables make the best sauces: they're earthy, bright, tart, sweet, bitter, savory, rich. Give them a treasured spot at the top of your grocery list and you'll never be bored.

### Always Buy Eggs

With these babies in your fridge, you're only ever minutes away from a satisfying meal. Scramble an egg with some leftovers or drop an egg on top of a salad, a bowl of grains, or a plate of stir-fried vegetables, and deliciousness is guaranteed.

### Don't Buy Drinks

All the body needs drink-wise is water. Except for milk, most packaged drinks are overpriced and deliver a lot of sugar without filling you up the way a piece of fruit or a bowl of yogurt does. If you want a special drink, make an agua fresca (p. 109), smoothie (p. 110), or tea.

### Buy a Pepper Grinder

Seriously, banish pre-ground pepper from your life; it loses all flavor when it sits around. Pepper is not just some dusty, crunchy black stuff that people seem to think is important; it's essential to bringing out the best in everything. Fresh pepper creates pops of intense flavor on the tongue and lights up bland dishes. One of the most popular dishes in Rome is just pasta with butter and pepper: give it a try!

# Breakfast

Fast, healthy and cheap is usually the game plan for breakfast—with as much pleasing flavor as I can manage in my grouchy morning state. Whether you have hours or minutes, there's a great breakfast to be had for little.

## Tomato Scrambled Eggs (for two)

- For two
- $3.60 total $1.80 / serving

For today's breakfast, fluffy, creamy eggs hold together a mass of tangy, juicy, sweet tomatoes.

#### Ingredients

- ½ tbsp butter
- 4 cups tomatoes, chopped
- 4 eggs
- salt and pepper
- basil or other herbs, chopped (optional)

#### Instructions

Put a small pan on medium heat and melt the butter, then swirl it around to coat the pan. Add the tomatoes. Cook until the tomatoes release their juice and most of the juice evaporates, about 5 to 7 minutes.

Meanwhile, crack the eggs into a bowl and add a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Beat the eggs lightly with a fork.

Once most of the juice has cooked out of the tomatoes, turn the heat down to low and add the eggs to the pan. Using a spatula, gently mix the eggs and tomatoes. Carefully stir the eggs to keep them from forming chunks. Turn down the heat as low as possible; the slower your eggs cook, the creamier they'll be.

Once the eggs are done, turn off the heat and add any chopped herbs you have around. Basil is the best with tomatoes. If you have some around, serve over toast or a tortilla.

## Oatmeal

- $0.25 total $0.13 / serving

This basic recipe can be dressed up in so many ways, you'll never get bored. Oatmeal makes a hot and comforting breakfast; it'll give you energy for a great morning. It's also extremely inexpensive, so you can spend a bit more on lunch and dinner.

#### Ingredients

- 1 cup rolled oats
- 2 cups water
- ¼ tsp salt

#### Instructions

In a small pot, add the oats, water and salt. Place it on medium-high heat, just until the water comes to a boil. Immediately turn the heat to low and place a lid on the pot. Cook for 5 minutes, until the oats are soft and tender and most of the water has cooked off. You can add more water if you like your oatmeal smooth and thin, or use slightly less if you want a thick oatmeal.

This is just the basic recipe; several ideas for how to make it your own follow on the next pages. Whether it's milky and sweet or savory and salty, I'm sure you can find a favorite way to enjoy a hot bowl of oats in the morning!

### Coconut and Lime Oatmeal ($1.50 total $0.75 / serving)

Add the coconut and sugar to the oatmeal, water, and salt. Cook as normal. Turn off the heat and squeeze the juice of half a lime over the top.

- ¼ cup coconut, shredded
- 2 tbsp sugar
- ½ lime, juiced

### Berry Oatmeal ($1.10 total $0.55 / serving)

Cook the oatmeal as usual, but 2 minutes before it's ready, add some fresh or frozen berries and the sugar, then stir to combine. There's nothing more to the recipe than that, but it's surprising how many variations you can come up with just by trying a new type of berries or combining several varieties.

- ½ cup berries, fresh or frozen
- 1 tbsp sugar

### Pumpkin Oatmeal ($1.50 total $0.75 / serving)

Whisk the pumpkin, milk, and water in a pot. Add the oats, salt, sugar, and spices, but omit the normal 2 cups water. Cook on medium-low until it bubbles. Turn to low for 5 more minutes. Add syrup or more sugar to taste.

- ½ cup canned pumpkin ¾ cup milk (or almond / soy milk)
- 1¼ cups water 2 tbsp brown sugar 1 tsp cinnamon

(optional)

- ¼ tsp ginger powder ¼ tsp clove powder
- maple syrup

### Baklava Oatmeal ($1.50 total $0.75 / serving)

Before cooking the oatmeal as normal, add the cinnamon, orange zest and 2 tablespoons of honey. Once it's cooked, top each bowl with another tablespoon of honey and a tablespoon of nuts.

- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 1 tbsp orange zest, finely grated
- 4 tbsp honey
- 2 tbsp almonds or pistachios, chopped

### Apple Cinnamon Oatmeal ($2 total $1 / serving)

Cook the oats in juice and cinnamon instead of water. Top with the apple. If you want the apple to be soft and warm, cook it along with the oats.

- 2 cups apple juice or cider
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 1 apple, cored and chopped

### Savory Oatmeal (1.50 total $0.75 / serving)

Cook the oatmeal with scallions. Just before it's done, add cheese. Melt the butter in a pan on medium heat. Crack in the eggs, then cover. Fry until the yolks are runny but the whites are cooked, then top each bowl of oats with one fried egg!

- 2-3 scallions, finely chopped
- ¼ cup sharp cheddar, grated
- 1 tsp butter
- 2 eggs

## Broiled Grapefruit

- $2 total $1 / serving

If your oven has a broiler, this is a fast and fun way to liven up a standard, healthy breakfast of grapefruit. This method produces a hot and sticky treat.

#### Ingredients

- 2 grapefruit
- 2 tbsp brown sugar
- Salt

#### Instructions

Turn on the broiler in your oven.

Split a grapefruit in half and place it on a baking tray or in an oven-proof pan. Sprinkle the pink halves evenly with sugar and top with just a tiny bit of salt to bring out the flavor.

Place the grapefruit halves under the broiler until they turn bubbly and a little brown (or even black) around the edges. This usually takes about 3 minutes, but monitor it because every broiler is different. Don't get distracted! Overbroiling ruins a good meal fast.

If you have maple sugar on hand, use it instead of sugar for even more flavor.

This breakfast will make a grapefruit lover out of you!

## Omelette

- For two
- $1.40 total $0.80 / serving

I make this omelette at least once a week. It's insanely delicious, whether laden with veggies or kept simple. I love it with dill, but it's good with almost any herb or scallions. Once you are a pro at making this, add any other cooked veggies you have around.

#### Ingredients

- 4 eggs
- 2 tbsp fresh dill, finely chopped
- salt and pepper
- butter for the pan
- 1 shallot or ½ small red onion,
- finely diced
- ¼ cup grated cheese

#### Instructions

Crack the eggs in a bowl. Add the dill, salt, pepper, and beat with a fork.

Put a big saucepan on medium-high heat. Melt a small blob of butter in the pan. Once the butter is sizzling, add the onion and sauté for about two minutes, until it's translucent and smells great.

Add the egg to the hot pan and swirl it around to coat the surface evenly. If the center of the omelette cooks more quickly than the edge, use a spatula to pull any raw egg into the middle. Then stop touching it.

After about 30 seconds, toss the cheese on top along with any other raw or cooked vegetable you feel like adding. Once none of the egg remains translucent, fold the omelette in half with your spatula, then lift it out of the pan. You don't want any brown on your eggs.

If I'm serving two people, I usually cut one large omelette in half rather than making two omelettes. However, when you feel like being fancy, you can make a pair of two-egg omelettes simply by using half the ingredients for each. For extra fanciness, roll up the omelette instead of folding it—that's how the French do it, traditionally. The result will be quite thin and tender.

## Banana Pancakes

- Makes ten to fourteen pancakes
- $2.80 total $0.70 / serving

With the creamy texture and delicious flavor of bananas, these pancakes are stunningly good. You will be seriously popular if you feed these to your family or friends. Another plus: this is a great way to get rid of mushy bananas (that doesn't involve making banana bread).

#### Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 bananas, mashed
- 2 eggs
- 1½ cups milk
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 2 bananas, sliced
- butter for cooking

#### Instructions

In a medium bowl, add the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, soda and salt. Mix thoroughly with a spoon.

In another bowl, add the mashed bananas (or just mash them in the bowl), eggs, milk, and vanilla, then mix. Add the dry mixture from the other bowl into the second bowl. Gently stir it with a spoon until everything just comes together. Tender pancakes come from not over-mixing the batter. If there are still a few pockets of flour, don't worry about it. Let the mixture sit for 10 to 15 minutes.

Place a non-stick or cast-iron pan on medium heat. Once it's hot, melt a small amount of butter, about ½ teaspoon, then ladle some pancake batter into the center of the pan. You can make your pancakes as large or small as you like. A normal amount is about 1/3 to 1/4 cup of batter. If it's your first time making pancakes, make them smaller: they'll be easier to flip.

As soon as the batter is in the pan, place 3 to 4 banana slices atop of the uncooked side of the pancake. Once the edges of the pancake start to dry up and you can see the middle start to bubble, flip the pancake over. Cook until it is browned on both sides. Stack the finished pancake on a plate in a warm oven and repeat the above process until you run out of batter.

Serve hot, with butter and syrup

## Whole-Wheat Jalapeño Cheddar Scones

- Makes six
- $4.50 total $0.75 / scone

These are delicious for breakfast or with a plate of beans, a pile of vegetables, or alongside a chili or stew. Spicy, cheesy, flaky—these are best eaten straight out of the oven.

#### Ingredients

- ½ cup butter
- 2½ cups whole-wheat flour
- 1 tbsp baking powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 4 oz sharp cheddar, diced
- 1 jalapeño, finely diced
- 2 eggs, lightly beaten
- ½ cup milk

Egg Wash

- 1 egg
- salt and pepper

#### Instructions

Place the butter in the freezer for 30 minutes.

Turn the oven to 400 F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, or lightly grease the pan if you don't have the paper.

In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt.

Prepare your jalapeño and cheese. Cutting the cheese into cubes rather than grating it means you'll have pockets of gooey cheese that contrast nicely with the scone. If you want the spice of the jalapeño, leave the seeds and membrane; if you like it milder, remove them and chop up only the pepper itself.

Remove the butter from the freezer and grate it directly into the flour mixture. (Use a cheese grater—it's the best way to break up butter without melting it.) Using your hands, gently squish the butter into the flour until everything is incorporated but not smooth. The chunks of butter will create flaky scones. Add the jalapeño, cheese, eggs, and milk to the bowl, then use your hands to gently mix everything until it just comes together. It will probably be a little shaggy, but that's just fine.

Sprinkle flour on a clean countertop and dump the dough onto it. Gently shape the dough into a disc about 1½" thick. Cut the dough into six triangles, like a pizza, and move them to the cookie sheet.

In a small bowl, gently beat the egg for the egg wash. Brush it over the scones, then sprinkle salt and pepper over each one. Bake for 25 minutes or until the scones are golden brown.

## Ideas: Yogurt Smash

There are so many types of yogurt in the grocery store: some low in fat and high in sugar, some with cute animal pictures. Some are Greek. Some have chocolate shavings and candy. Some have names like "key lime pie."

Now forget about all of that. The best value for your money are the big buckets of plain yogurt. The fat content is your choice—just check that it doesn't contain gelatin and you're all set. Starting with plain yogurt, you can make super flavors in your own kitchen, where you know exactly what's going into it.

If you have kids, ask them what flavors they can imagine and go make it! It's a lot more fun than letting the supermarket choose for you. Try something new and smash it in! Check out the ideas on the adjoining page.

If you want a thicker Greek-style yogurt, all you have to do is strain regular American yogurt through cheesecloth to remove the extra water.

Yogurt's versatility makes it a great staple to keep in the fridge. Mix it with some of the items you see on the next page or turn it into a savory sauce like raita (p. 122) or tzatziki (p. 123).

**Examples** : peanut butter, bananas, jam, grapes, blueberries, raspberries, kiwi, coconut, lime, honey

# Soup

It's a cliché, but as soon as the weather gets cold, my apartment fills with the smell of vegetables simmering for soup. Vegetable soups are so simple that you can easily invent your own, using the stuff you and your family like. Start with some onion, carrot, celery, maybe a pepper; then add broth and a large amount of, say, spinach, and suddenly you have spinach soup! It's a great way for new cooks to gain some confidence. Just remember to season it enough. Dunk a grilled-cheese sandwich in it 24 and even mediocre soup tastes great.

## Dal

- For four
- $2.40 total $0.60 / serving

This thick lentil soup is a flavor-packed staple of the Indian table. There are a ton of ways to prepare dal, but the core—beyond the lentils themselves—is usually ginger, garlic, and chili, along with some dry spices.

#### Ingredients

- 2 cups lentils
- 1 tbsp butter
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 tsp black mustard seeds
- 1 tsp turmeric powder
- 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 green chili, finely chopped
- ½ inch ginger root, grated
- salt and pepper

#### Instructions

You can use any type of lentil you like. If you're using larger lentils (like chana dal, french lentils, or split mung beans), soak them for 30 minutes to start. If you're using the small orange lentils, then don't bother soaking them; they cook very quickly.

Melt butter in a saucepan on medium heat. Add the onion and let it cook for 1 minute, then add the cumin and mustard seeds and stir them around with the onions until they sizzle. Toss in the turmeric powder, garlic, and chili and cook for 3 to 4 more minutes. Add the ginger root and stir fry quickly for about 30 seconds.

Add the lentils along with enough water to cover them, then place a lid on top. Let everything cook for 20 to 45 minutes, or until the lentils are tender. Taste the dal and add salt and pepper. You'll probably need a fair bit of salt to bring out all the flavors—a teaspoon or so.

If you have them available, top the dish with a splash of cream or some chopped fresh cilantro.

## Corn Soup

- For four to six
- $5 total $1.25 / serving

This thick, sweet, satisfying soup is a favorite of kids and adults. This is wonderful to make at the beginning of autumn when corn on the cob is at its peak, but canned corn can also make it a warm reminder of summer in the depths of winter.

#### Ingredients

- 4 cups corn, fresh, canned, or frozen
- 1 tbsp butter 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 sticks celery, finely chopped
- 1 green or red bell pepper, finely chopped
- 1 small potato, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 chili pepper, finely chopped (optional)
- 1 tbsp cornmeal or flour
- salt and pepper

Corn Broth

- 4 to 8 cobs corn, with corn removed 2 bay leaves (optional)
- salt

Alternate Broth

- 5 cups vegetable broth or chicken stock

#### Instructions

If you're making this soup with corn on the cob, the first step is to make corn broth. If you're using canned or frozen corn, you'll also need chicken or vegetable broth instead. In that case, skip the next paragraph.

To make corn broth, place the cobs and bay leaves in a large stockpot and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then turn the heat down to medium and let the water boil for about 30 minutes. Taste the broth and add salt and pepper until it tastes lightly corny. Boil it down until you have about 5 cups of liquid. The broth will keep for several months if frozen, or a few weeks in the refrigerator.

To make the soup, melt the butter in a large pot or Dutch oven on medium heat. Add onion, celery, bell pepper, and potato, then stir. Cover the pot and let everything fry and steam for about 5 minutes.

Take the lid off the pot and add the garlic and chili pepper, if using. Stir the vegetables, using a splash of water or broth to free any that get stuck to the bottom of the pot.

Let the vegetables cook, stirring occasionally, for another 5 minutes. They should be lightly browned and soft, although the potatoes will not be fully cooked yet.

Add the corn and cornmeal or flour to the pot and stir. Cover with about 5 cups of broth and bring to a boil, then turn the heat down to low and simmer for about 30 minutes. The broth will thicken and become opaque.

Add salt and pepper to taste. If you made your own corn broth, you'll probably need at least a teaspoon of salt; if you used store-bought broth, you'll need less.

Serve with a slice of garlic bread or add a hard-boiled egg for extra protein.

## Lightly Curried Butternut Squash Soup

- For four
- $6.00 total $1.50 per serving

Squash is almost the perfect vegetable for soup: it's flavorful and has a divinely smooth texture when cooked and pureed. Serve this soup to people who think they don't like squash or curry, and you'll change some minds. You can substitute any winter squash for the butternut; I just like butternut because it's faster to peel and chop than its many cousins.

#### Ingredients

- 1 butternut squash or other winter squash
- 1 tbsp butter
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 1 green bell pepper, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 tsp cumin powder
- 1 tsp coriander powder
- 1 tsp turmeric powder
- 1 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 can coconut milk
- 3 cups water
- salt and pepper

Optional

- sour cream
- scallions
- cilantro

#### Instructions

To prepare the squash, peel off the tough skin with a potato peeler. Cut the squash in half lengthwise with a sharp chef's knife, then scoop out the seeds and gloop. (You can save the seeds for a tasty snack later, if you like: just clean the gloop off, then toast them.)

Next, slice off the stem and very bottom of the squash and throw them away. Take each half of the squash and place it face-down on a cutting board. Slice each across into ½" sticks, then turn each slice into cubes.

Put a large pot or Dutch oven on the stove on medium heat. Melt the butter and let the pot get hot. Add the onion, pepper, and garlic, then sauté for two minutes.

Add the cubed squash and spices and stir it all together. Put a lid on the pot and let it cook for another two minutes. Add the coconut milk and water and stir.

Bring the soup to a boil, then turn down the heat to low and let it cook for about 30 minutes, or until the squash is tender.

Once the squash is tender, taste the soup and add salt and pepper as needed. Soup usually needs a fair bit of salt, so be generous.

If you have an immersion blender, you can purée the soup in the pot. If you have a normal blender, wait until the soup has cooled before transferring it to the blender. Purée until smooth, then taste again and add any more salt and pepper it might need.

You can enjoy the soup as-is or serve it with another drizzle of coconut milk or a dollop of sour cream, plus 28 some chopped scallions or cilantro.

# Salad

There isn’t much to a great salad: just fresh vegetables, crunchy stuff, plus a little something rich like cheese, nuts, a buttery crouton, or a creamy dressing. The dressing should be well seasoned with salt and have a nice hit of vinegar or citrus to bring out the other flavors. Don’t bother with store-bought dressing. It usually tastes lousy and is full of cheap oils and chemicals; you can make better and cheaper dressing at home with just a few pantry items. Salad shouldn’t be something you choke down or grudgingly serve as an afterthought. Make it something you look forward to by adding your favorite flavors to it.

## Broiled Eggplant Salad
- for two
- $4.50 total $2.35 / serving

Even if you aren’t a big eggplant fan, you might enjoy this despite yourself. Broiled eggplant has a crunchy and meaty texture, and the tahini dressing makes the salad rich and creamy.

#### Ingredients

- 1 medium eggplant, sliced into circles
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tbsp tahini
- sprinkle of chili flakes (optional)
- fresh dill, finely chopped (optional)
- salt and pepper

#### Instructions

Turn on your oven’s broiler. Arrange the slices of eggplant on a baking sheet, then place them under the broiler for about 3 minutes. Watch them carefully. Once they begin to blacken, remove them from the oven and flip the slices over. Repeat the process on the other side. Once your eggplant is nicely charred, chop it into bite-sized pieces.

In a bowl, mix the tahini, lemon juice, and chili flakes (if using), plus plenty of salt and pepper. Add the eggplant and stir it around. Add more salt or lemon juice according to your taste, then top it with dill if available, and serve!

## Kale Salad
- For two, or four as a side
- $4.50 total $2.25 / serving

This kale is treated like romaine lettuce in a ceasar salad. The bitterness of the greens is delicious alongside the rich, fatty, dressing. You could also use Swiss chard.

#### Ingredients

- 1 large bunch kale
- 2 cups bread cubes
- 2 tbsp butter (more as needed)
- salt and pepper
- Romano or Parmesan, freshly grated

Dressing
- 1 egg yolk
- 2 tsp lemon juice
- 2 tsp Dijon mustard
- 1 clove garlic, finely grated
- 1 anchovy, finely chopped
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- salt and pepper

#### Instructions

Start by making croutons.

To make the dressing, drop the egg yolk into a large mixing bowl. Add the lemon juice, mustard, garlic, and anchovy. Whisk briskly until the dressing is light and frothy. Slowly add the olive oil, whisking the whole time. Once everything is incorporated, add the salt and pepper, then adjust to your taste. I like it very lemony.

Cut the kale leaves to remove the large stem from the center. (Lacinato kale, sometimes called Tuscan kale, has the easiest stems to remove.) Slice the leaves in half lengthwise, then cut into thin ribbons. Chopping the kale into small pieces disguises its tough texture.

Toss the kale in the bowl to coat it with dressing. Set aside for 10 minutes or leave in the fridge for a few hours. The kale will become tender as it marinates.

Before serving, toss in the croutons and top with Romano cheese.

## Taco Salad
- For two
- $5.20 total $2.60 / serving

This salad is a great use for leftover beans (or pulled pork)—crunchy, fresh, yet satisfying enough to be a whole meal. I like to make taco salad in a week where I’ve made a large batch of beans and I’m craving something fresh.

#### Ingredients

- 4 cups lettuce, chopped
- 1 cup beans, pulled pork, or ground beef
- 2 small tomatoes, chopped
- ½ cup corn, canned or fresh
- 2-3 scallions, finely chopped
- 1 cup tortilla chips, roughly crushed
- sharp cheddar or queso fresco, for sprinkling

Dressing
- ¼ cup sour cream or yogurt
- juice of one lime
- salt and pepper

Additions
- cucumber
- jalapeño
- bell peppers
- grated carrots
- salsa

#### Instructions

Mix up the dressing and taste it. Adjust the salt, pepper, and lime to your liking.

Mix the other ingredients in a large bowl. Pour the dressing over just before serving and toss to coat the salad evenly. Eat immediately, maybe with a few extra tortilla chips on the side.

## Beet and Chickpea Salad
- For two
- $3.50 total $1.75 / serving

This dish is spicy, crunchy, and almost certainly the pinkest salad you’ll ever eat! Don’t be scared.

#### Ingredients

- 2 to 3 beets, peeled and grated
- 1 cup chickpeas, cooked or canned
- 3 tbsp peanuts

Dressing
- 1 tbsp lime juice
- 1 tsp chili sauce
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- salt and pepper

#### Instructions

Peel the beets, removing the stems if necessary, then shred the beets with a box grater. Place the beets in a bowl along with the chickpeas and nuts.

Mix up the dressing ingredients in another small bowl and stir to combine. Taste and adjust the salt and pepper to your liking.

Add the dressing to the other bowl and mix up all the ingredients. Let it sit for about 5 minutes so that the flavors can soak into the vegetables and the beet juices can mingle with the dressing.

## Cold (Spicy?) Noodles
- For four
- $5 Total $1.24 / serving

On a hot day, this is all I want to eat. Cold but spicy food is refreshing and delicious in the summer. If you have some spice oil on hand, be sure to add it. It’s amazing in this.

#### Ingredients

- 12 oz noodles (spaghetti, soba, or any Asian noodles)
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 bunch scallions, chopped
- 1 cucumber, finely chopped
- salt and pepper

Additions
- spice oil (p. 120)
- peanut sauce (p. 125)
- grated carrot
- shredded cabbage
- bean sprouts
- hard-boiled egg
- chopped tomato

#### Instructions

Prepare the noodles according to the package instructions. Rinse them under cold water and put them in a colander to drain.

Put the noodles in a bowl and add the soy sauce, spice oil if you have it, scallions, and cucumber (and any other additions). Mix it all together with a fork or a tongs. Taste it and add salt and pepper or more spice oil as needed.

Let the noodles sit in the fridge for about an hour if you can. The flavors will mingle and become more intense.

Think of this as a recipe that you can really make your own. Use whatever sauce or dressing you like and whatever vegetables you have around, or just a few scallions.

## Broccoli Apple Salad
- FOR FOUR
- $3.20 TOTAL $0.80 / SERVING

The texture of thinly sliced apple and broccoli is wonderfully crunchy, and the bitterness of the broccoli with the sweet and tart apples is delicious.

#### Ingredients

- 1 large crown and stem of broccoli
- 2 apples

DRESSING
- 1 lemon, juiced
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- salt and pepper

ALTERNATE DRESSING
- 1 tbsp yogurt
- 1 tsp olive oil
- 1 tsp lemon juice
- 1 tsp chopped fresh dill
- salt and pepper

#### Instructions

Slice the stem of the broccoli into 1/8” discs. If you can’t get them that thin, don’t worry, but the thinner the better if you have the patience! Once you reach the crown of the broccoli, cut each of the florets off and slice each of them as thinly as you can as well. Set the broccoli in a bowl.

Halve and core the apples, then place the apples flat side down on your cutting board to make them easier to slice. Slice the apples into 1/8” pieces as well, then dump them into the same bowl.

Choose either of the dressing options and prepare it by simply mixing the ingredients together in a small bowl. Taste it and season with more salt and pepper to match your preferences.

Pour the dressing over the bowl of vegetables and mix it all together. If you want to make the presentation nice, put a plate in the fridge for 10 minutes, then serve the salad piled as high and tight as you can manage.

# Snacks & Small Bites

When cooking on a budget, snacks are often the first thing you shave away. If you’re creative, though, you can make plenty of cheap, healthy and delightful snacks to enjoy in all seasons and on any occasion. (And remember, leftovers make great snacks, too!)

## IDEAS: Things on Toast

I love bread, and toast in particular is my comfort food—I crave it when I’m sick or worn down. Here, I would like to suggest that you take some toast and put something tasty on it. That’s it!

Certainly toast can feed a crowd, but I like this meal for times when I’m on my own and want a quick meal or snack. It’s a great way to use leftovers or turn a side dish into a full meal.

What makes this more like a special dinner than a quick snack is the way you treat the bread—toasting it in the pan like a nice piece of fish.

A pile of sautéed or raw veggies over buttered, toasty bread is the perfect meal for one and a great way to try a new vegetable. I’ve suggested a few other toast variations on the following pages, but you can use pretty much any veggie dish from this book or invent your own. Add a fried egg on top if you’re extra hungry.

Melt ½ tablespoon of butter in a small pan on medium heat. Place the two slices of bread in the pan and let them cook for about 2 minutes, then lift them with a spatula to check whether they’re golden brown underneath. When they are, flip ’em over.

Add the rest of the butter to the pan to make sure the second side of the toast becomes just as golden as the first. Sprinkle the top of the bread with salt and pepper. Once the second side is golden, set the bread on a plate to await its topping.

For the toppings, you can go raw or, as I most often do, sauté veggies or beans with flavors like garlic and chilies, olives and and dill, ginger and turmeric, or any other classic combination (p. 126).

Instead of toast, the topping ideas on the next few pages would also be great over rice or any other grain, in a tortilla, tossed with pasta, or even on a pizza. It’s up to you!

### PEAS AND LEMON
- $2 TOTAL $1 / SERVING

This is like a less-salty, more-rustic version of the British classic mushy peas. Add a bit of olive oil to a pan on medium heat. Drop in the peas along with 2 tablespoons of water so that they can steam a bit. Leave them until they turn bright green. Sprinkle with lemon zest and Parmesan, then remove the peas from the heat and mash them a bit with the back of a fork, either in the pan or in a bowl. Pile onto toast and enjoy!

- 1 tsp olive oil
- 1 cup peas, fresh or frozen
- 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 tsp lemon juice
- Romano or Parmesan, freshly grated
- salt and pepper

### ASIAN GREENS GRA PROW
- $5 TOTAL $2.50 / SERVING

This works with any Asian green, from bok choy to tatsoi to gai lan. Splash the oil in a pan on medium heat. Sauté the garlic for 2 minutes, then add the ginger, soy sauce, and the stem part of the greens. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until almost tender. Add the leafy part of the greens and cook for 2 more minutes. Turn off the heat and mix in the Thai basil. Taste and add salt and pepper, unless the soy sauce is salty enough on its own.

- 1 bunch Asian greens, stem separated from leaves
- 1 tsp vegetable oil
- 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 tsp fresh ginger, grated
- 2 tsp soy sauce
- 1 handful Thai basil
- salt and pepper

### CAREMALIZED ONIONS AND Cheddar
- $2 TOTAL $1 / SERVING

Melt the butter in a pan on low heat. Add the onions and let them cook slowly, about 20 minutes. As the onions darken, stir them occasionally, adding a bit of water to loosen up the sticky onion bits on the bottom and keep them from burning. Leave the onions until they’re dark purple. They will now be sweet and caramelized. Spread them over toast and top with slices of aged cheddar, salt, and pepper. Put the toast back in the pan and cover with a lid until the cheese is bubbly, then serve it up.

- 1 tbsp butter
- 1 red onion, thinly sliced
- sharp cheddar, thinly sliced
- salt and pepper

### ROASTED VEGETABLES
- $2 TOTAL $1 / SERVING

This is one of my favorite ways to eat leftover roasted vegetables. Simply create a ridiculously tall pile of vegetables like the winter squash and leeks pictured here, then sprinkle with grated Romano or Parmesan and fresh pepper. You can also add any sauce you have on hand or sprinkle crushed nuts on top.

- roasted vegetable
- Romano or Parmesan, freshly grated
- pepper

### SALTY BROCCOLI
- $3.50 TOTAL $1.50 / SERVING

Here’s yet another use for leftovers—or just a way to make a great salad more substantial. Simply dollop the broiled eggplant salad onto toast, then add some herbs or greens to the top for a fresh counterpoint, along with a bit of cheese.

- broiled eggplant salad
- fresh herbs or greens
- any cheese, crumbled or grated

### BLACK EYED PEAS AND COLLARDS
- $2 TOTAL $1 / SERVING

Oh man, is there anything more comforting than beans on toast? Friends and family will be delighted even if you’re secretly using up leftovers. To make the meal a little more fancy, use jalapeño-cheddar scones instead of toast.

- black-eyed peas and collards
- jalepeno-cheddar scones (optional)

### SPINACH AND CHICKPEA
- $4.50 TOTAL $2.25 / SERVING

This is a popular tapas dish in Spain. The recipe makes a little more topping than you need for two pieces of toast—but hey, leftovers are tasty. Melt the butter in a pan on medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for 2 minutes. Add the chickpeas and spinach, then cook for 2 to 5 minutes, until the spinach cooks down but is still bright green. Taste and add salt and pepper, then spoon it over toast. If you have it, sprinkle with smoked paprika.

- 1 tsp butter
- 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 cup cooked chickpeas
- 1 bunch spinach
- salt and pepper
- smoked paprika (optional)

## Leftover Polenta Fries

This is more of a method than a recipe. These are so crunchy and savory that you just might find yourself making batches of polenta just for the leftovers.

#### Ingredients

- polenta
- 1-2 tsp vegetable oil
- salt

#### Instructions

The night before, take your leftover cooked polenta and put it in a baking pan or flat piece of Tupperware. Anything with a flat surface on the bottom will do. Smooth the polenta down so it’s even and flat like you would if you were making brownies. Cover and leave it in the fridge over night.

The next day take the polenta out of the fridge. It should be one hardened mass. Carefully remove it from the pan. Slice the polenta into strips like french fries, of about 2” in length.

Put a pan on medium-high heat. Add some vegetable oil to the pan and let if get hot for about 30 seconds. Add the polenta strips. Sprinkle with salt to your taste. Fry until golden brown on all sides, using tongs or a spatula to gently flip them.

Serve with salsa and sour cream, ketchup, raita (p. 122), tzatziki, bean dip or anything you like. They’re great with a bowl of chili too in place of corn bread.

## Green Chili and Cheddar Quesadillas
- FOR TWO
- $3.50 TOTAL $1.75 / SERVING

These are a great snack or a quick meal, and you can add pretty much anything to them!

#### Ingredients

- 4 tortillas
- ½ cup sharp cheddar, grated
- ½ cup green chilies, canned or fresh, chopped
- 1 tbsp cilantro, chopped

#### Instructions

Spread ¼ cup of green chilies evenly over one tortilla. Sprinkle ¼ cup of cheese over the chilies, then top with half the cilantro. Place another tortilla on top of each prepared tortilla to form a quesadilla. Repeat!

Place a large, non-stick pan on medium heat. Once it’s hot, add a quesadilla and toast for about 1 minute. Flip it over and brown the second side, then do the same for the other quesadilla. Slice into triangles and enjoy with some fresh salsa (p. 121) and sour cream.

## Poutine
- FOR TWO, OR FOUR TO SIX AS A SIDE
- $7 TOTAL $3.50 / SERVING

Poutine isn’t an everyday meal, but it’s a favorite. Since I don’t like deep-frying at home, I bake the fries; they still get crispy without the fuss of frying.

Montreal-style poutine is made with vegetable gravy, as in this recipe, but you can also make your favorite beef or turkey gravy.

Of course, proper poutine uses cheese curds, and if you can find them do use those, but fresh mozzarella works for me. It has the same spongy quality, just maybe with a little less squeak. This recipe does comes out a little more expensive than you would think because of the fresh mozzarella. If you use less or skip the cheese entirely, you can cut the price in half.

#### Ingredients

- 2-3 medium Russet potatoes, sliced into sticks
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- salt and pepper
- scallions, chopped
- 6 oz fresh mozzarella, diced

GRAVY
- 2 tbsp butter
- 1 shallot or 3 scallions, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
- 1½ cups vegetable broth
- 1 tsp soy sauce
- ½ tsp cayenne pepper
- salt and pepper
- 6 leaves fresh sage, finely chopped (optional)

#### Instructions

Set the oven to 400 F.

Pour 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil onto a baking sheet. Spread the oil around, then spread out the sticks of sliced potato. Pour the rest of the oil over the top and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Use your hands to ensure the potatoes are coated with oil, salt, and pepper, and evenly spread across the pan. Place them in the oven and bake for 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, prepare the gravy. Melt the butter in a saucepan on medium heat. Add the shallot and garlic. Let them cook for 2 minutes until translucent, but not brown. Add the flour and quickly stir with a spoon. Add a little broth if gets too clumpy.

Let the mixture cook until it turns light brown. Add the vegetable broth, soy sauce, and cayenne pepper. Bring the gravy to a boil, then turn down the heat and let it cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste it, adding salt and pepper as needed. Turn down the heat to very low, just enough to keep the gravy warm until the fries come out of the oven.

Dice the mozzarella.

After the fries have baked for 20 minutes, remove them from the oven. Lift them with a spatula and test their tenderness with a fork. If it goes through easily, the fries are ready. If you want them a little more crispy, flip them over and put them back in the over for a few more minutes.

Once they’re done, pile one layer of fries onto a plate. Top with cheese and then the hot gravy. Repeat with a second layer before sprinkling with scallions and more freshly ground black pepper.

## IDEAS: Popcorn!
- FOR FOUR
- $1 TOTAL $0.25 / SERVING

Popcorn is such a great snack. It’s easy to forget how easy and cheap it is to prepare at home. Try some different toppings! I’ve suggested a few on the opposite page.

#### Ingredients

- 1/3 cup popcorn
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 2 tbsp butter, melted
- salt

#### Instructions

Place a large pot with a tight-fitting lid on the stove. Pour in the vegetable oil, then the popcorn kernels. Put the lid on and turn the heat to medium.

Using pot holders or oven mitts, occasionally shake the pot from side to side to make sure the kernels are evenly distributed in the oil. Once the popcorn begins to pop, turn the heat down to medium-low and gently shake again.

Once the popping slows down to 5 to 10 seconds between pops, turn the heat off. Wait until you’re sure the corn has stopped popping and remove the lid.

Move the popcorn to a bowl and pour butter, salt, and other spices or toppings over top. Gently toss to coat it evenly

This recipe makes about 10 to 12 cups of popped popcorn—enough for four people. Eat it while it’s hot!

### VARIATIONS
- Scallions and Cilantro
- Turmeric and Coriander
- Spice Oil
- Parm and Black Pepper
- Cayenne and Smaked Paprika
- Brown Sugar and Orange Zest
- Chili Powder and Lime
- Parm and Oregano

# Handheld

Sometimes you just don’t want to deal with plates and cutlery. Plus, eating with your hands is fun! These recipes are great for lunch, dinner, or for a casual party.

## Cauliflower Tacos
- FOR TWO TO THREE
- $6 Total $2 - $3 / SERVING

This is one of my favorite ways to use roasted cauliflower other than eating it straight. It’s a delicious change from the usual vegetable taco offerings. Just look at all those crunchy bits!

#### Ingredients

- roasted cauliflower (p. 58)
- 6 tortillas
- ½ cup cheese, grated
- ½ cup salsa (p. 163) or sauce of choice

#### Instructions

Warm up the tortillas in the microwave for 20 to 30 seconds, or put them in a warm oven covered with a towel while you prepare everything else.

Place two to three tortillas on each plate and fill with a generous serving of cauliflower.

Sprinkle the grated cheese over top and drizzle with salsa or sauce of your choice. Enjoy!

## Potato Leek Pizza
- MAKES FOUR PIZZAS
- $9 TOTAL $2.25 / Pizza

Obviously you should just make all kinds of pizza. Seriously, do it. Make it a Thursday night tradition and an excuse to use up leftovers. This pizza, for one, is a fun variation that confounds expectations—proof that, indeed, anything is good on pizza!

#### Ingredients

- pizza dough (p. 139)
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 Russet potato or 3 small potatoes, sliced into thin circles
- 3 leeks, sliced into circles
- salt and pepper
- 1 lb fresh mozzarella, shredded

#### Instructions

Turn the oven to 500 °F.

Put a large pan on medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Once the oil is hot, add the potato slices evenly to the pan, making sure each slice is touching the bottom. (If you slice them thin enough, they’ll turn out almost like little chips.)

Let them cook until they start to crinkle around the edges and turn brown. Flip them over and brown the other side, then move them to a bowl. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, then toss with your hands (after they cool down!) to make sure they’re evenly coated.

Heat up another tablespoon of oil in the same pan, then toss in the leek slices, stirring occasionally until they’re soft, about 5 minutes. Toss them with the potato slices and add a bit more salt and pepper.

Clear a space on the counter and sprinkle with flour. Divide your dough into 4 equal pieces. One at a time, stretch the doughs into crusts. You can use a rolling pin or just slowly use your fingers and hands. I like to make mine really thin and big, but it’s up to you how thick to make it.

Once the crust is the desired shape and thickness, dust the back of a cookie sheet with flour or cornmeal to keep the crust from sticking, then place it the dough on the sheet.

Now layer it with ¼ of the potato and leek mixture and ¼ of the shredded mozzarella. Bake for 5 to 8 minutes. If it’s your first time, simply keep an eye on the oven to see when the pizza’s done. The crust should be light brown and the cheese melted.

## Broccoli Rabe and Mozzarella Calzones
- MAKES FOUR Calzones
- $6 TOTAL $1.50 / CALZONE

Calzones are pizza in a slightly different form—a form that lets you get stuff in more filling without weighing down the crust. Broccoli rabe is great, but you can use any bitter green, or even broccoli or cauliflower. You’ll love these crusty pockets full of oozy goodness!

#### Ingredients

- pizza dough (p. 139)
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 large bunch broccoli rabe, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 tsp chili flakes
- 2 anchovies, finely chopped (optional)
- salt and pepper
- 2 cups grated mozzarella cheese

#### Instructions

Turn the oven to 500 °F (or as hot as your oven gets). Sprinkle a small amount of flour or cornmeal over a baking sheet and set aside.

Place a large pan on medium heat and add the olive oil. Once the oil is hot, add the tough stem ends of the broccoli rabe and cook for 2 minutes. Next, add the rest of the broccoli rabe, including the leafy parts, along with the garlic, chili flakes, and anchovies. Give the ingredients a stir and let it cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add salt and pepper to taste. The broccoli rabe is done when the stems are tender. Set the filling aside.

Divide the pizza dough into 4 equal pieces. Sprinkle flour over the countertop and place one of the four pieces of dough on it. Using your hands or a rolling pin, roll out the dough as you would for pizza (p. 79).

Roll the dough out quite thin. Pile ¼ of your broccoli rabe mixture and ½ cup of mozzarella onto one side of the circle, leaving a lip around the edge.

Gather up the half of the dough that isn’t weighed down with filling and fold it over top. Pinch the edges of the dough together to create a half-moon shape. Place it carefully on the prepared baking sheet and repeat until you have four calzones.

Bake for 6 to 8 minutes or until the calzones are golden-brown on the outside. Be careful when you bite into them—they’ll be hot!

## Broccoli, Egg, and Cheddar Empanadas
- MAKES TWELVE
- $7.50 TOTAL $0.60 / EMPANADA

In case you can’t tell by now, I am partial to tasty dough stuffed with something even tastier. Every culture has its own version, so when you think about it that way, having empanadas, dumplings, perogies, and calzones in one book isn’t that crazy—right? My friend Barb felt the same way, so I created this recipe for her.

#### Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose or whole-wheat flour
- ½ cup cornmeal
- ½ tsp salt
- ¼ cup butter
- 1 egg
- ½ cup cold water

FILLING
- 4 cups broccoli with stems, chopped
- 1 cup water
- 9 eggs
- 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- ½ tsp chili flakes
- salt and pepper
- 1 cup sharp cheddar, grated

#### Instructions

Mix the flour, cornmeal, and salt in a large bowl. The cornmeal isn’t traditional in empanadas—I just like the extra crunch it gives. You can substitute more flour for the cornmeal if you like.

Place the butter in the freezer for 10 minutes, then grate it directly into the flour mixture. Wash and dry your hands, then use them to gently squish the butter into the flour until it looks like bread crumbs.

Make a crater in the flour mixture. Crack the egg into it along with the water. Mix with your hands until it comes together into a smooth ball. If you’re using whole-wheat flour and the dough seems dry, add another tablespoon of water. Cover with plastic wrap or a moist towel.

Put the broccoli and water in a pan over medium heat. Cover it with a lid. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes, until the water is gone and the broccoli is tender.

Meanwhile, crack 8 of the eggs into a bowl, saving the last one for an egg wash later. Mix the eggs with the garlic, chili flakes, salt, and pepper.

Once the broccoli is tender, pour the eggs into the pan. Stir until just scrambled, about 2 minutes. Turn off the heat, add the cheese, and stir.

Heat the oven to 400 °F. Lightly oil or butter two baking sheets.

Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces and roll each into a ball. Dust your counter lightly with flour, then use a rolling pin to flatten each ball into a thin circle, a little bigger than a DVD. Place some filling on one side of the circle, then fold over the other side to form a half moon. Pinch the edges and place the empanada on a baking sheet. Repeat!

If you own a pastry brush, an egg wash will make the empanadas shinier. Since it doesn’t affect the taste, only how the empanadas look, this step is very optional. In a small bowl, beat an egg with a fork. Brush the tops of the empanadas with the egg wash.

Bake for 20 minutes, until they turn golden brown.

## Potato and Kale Rolls with Raita
- FOR FOUR
- $5.25 TOTAL $0.66 / Roll

These are a great meal to make when you have leftover roti and raita. The filling comes together in minutes and could be anything, but potatoes and greens are tasty and filling.

#### Ingredients

- 8 roti (p. 138)
- 2 large or 4 medium potatoes, chopped
- 1 bunch kale or spinach, chopped with stems removed
- 1 tbsp ghee or butter
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- ½ cup onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 tbsp ginger, finely grated
- 1 tsp turmeric powder
- 1 tsp coriander powder
- 1 tsp cayenne powder
- raita (p. 164)
- fresh cilantro

#### Instructions

Put a skillet on medium heat and add the ghee or butter. (Ghee, which is traditional in Indian cooking, is just butter with the milk solids removed, and it can withstand higher temperatures than butter without burning.)

Once the butter is hot, add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle for 5 seconds before adding the diced onion. Let the onion cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.

In a small bowl, mix the garlic, ginger, turmeric, coriander, cayenne powder, salt, and 1 tablespoon of water.

Add the spices to the onion mixture and mix, cooking for another 2 minutes. It will smell strongly aromatic. This step is important because the spices become toasted and release their flavor.

Next, add the potatoes. Stir to coat them with the onions and spices. Add about a cup of water and cover the pan with a lid. Let it cook for about 10 minutes, checking occasionally to stir and make sure nothing is burning. Add more water as needed. You want the final mixture to be only a bit moist, but the water helps everything cook evenly.

Test the potatoes with a fork: if you can easily pierce them, they’re ready. Once they are, add the kale and stir until the kale is wilted. Taste and add more salt if needed.

To assemble the rolls, scoop 1/8 of the mixture into the center of a roti, distributing it in an even line. Roll it up.

Serve two roti per person with cilantro and a generous dollop of raita, either over the top or on the side.

## IDEAS: Leftovers

Leftovers are convenient, but can seem unappealing, limp, and cold after sitting in the fridge for a couple of days. That’s why the sandwich, the wrap, and the taco are your friend. Here are just a few ideas for how to give leftovers a makeover very quickly for a whole new meal!

**TOMATO SCRAMBLED EGGS WRAP (p. 15)**
Throw the tomato eggs into a wrap and add some roasted potatoes or rice for bulk.

**JACKET SWEET POTATOES SPREAD (p. 57)**
Mash up leftover baked sweet potatoes, then spread them in a bacon sandwich for a sweet counterpoint.

**TOAST TOPPINGS ON ANYTHING (p. 69-73)**
Any of the toast toppings would work in a wrap, as a calzone filling, or as a pizza topping.

**CAULIFLOWER TACOS (p. 77)**
Tacos are the perfect re-use of roasted cauliflower.

**CHANA MASALA WRAP (p. 93)**
Sounds strange, but spread some herbed mayo on the wrap and then pile in the chana masala.

**BLACK-EYED PEAS AND COLLARDS WRAP (p. 96)**
Fold the black-eyed peas and collards into a wrap with a little hot sauce or some tzatziki.

**VEGETABLE JAMBALAYA BURRITO (p. 97)**
Add some salsa or any leftover beans.

**CAULIFLOWER CHEESE SANDWICH (p. 113)**
Add some crunchy greens and mustard. Yum!

**ROASTED VEGETABLES SANDWICH (p. 122)**
Add some extra spices or sauces to liven up the vegetables and grill the bread for some crunch.

**ROASTED POTATOES AND CHILIES (p. 125)**
This dish is great in a taco—just add a little salsa and grated cheese. I like green salsa here.

**TILAPIA TACO (p. 126)**
For a makeshift fish taco, chop up some crunchy cabbage and cilantro.

# Dinner

My favorite meal of the day. For me, eating dinner indicates that the hard work is done: it’s time for family, relaxing, and the more optional endeavors. A great dinner is an opportunity to show love to those you are cooking for and to yourself.

## Creamy Zucchini Fettuccine
- FOR THREE
- $3.50 TOTAL $1.17 / SERVING

Zucchini and summer squash are so abundant in the summer months. This simple pasta is like a lighter, brighter fettuccine alfredo. It also comes together in no time—the veggies will be ready by the time your pasta is cooked. You’ll love it, I promise.

#### Ingredients

- ½ lb fettuccine
- 4 tbsp butter
- 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- ½ tsp chili flakes
- 2 small zucchini, finely diced
- 1 lemon, zested
- ¼ cup cream ½ cup Romano or Parmesan, grated
- salt and pepper
- fresh basil, finely
- chopped (optional)

#### Instructions

Bring a pot of water to boil over high heat. Salt the water liberally. This is how pasta gets salted, so don’t be shy! Most won’t end up in the pasta.

Cook the pasta according to the package directions. I prefer my pasta with some bite, so I drain the pasta just before it’s finished so it doesn’t get mushy when I add it to the vegetable pan to cook slightly more.

Meanwhile, melt a tablespoon of butter in a pan on medium heat. Add the garlic and chili flakes. Let them sizzle for 30 seconds to a minute, then add the zucchini. Stir the vegetables to coat them. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until some of the water has cooked off and the veggies are tender when stabbed with a fork. Young summer zucchini doesn’t need much cooking. Add the lemon zest. Stir!

Drain the cooked fettuccine and add it to the zucchini pan along with the rest of the butter, the cream, and most of the Romano cheese. Toss the fettuccine around the pan to get everything mixed. Add salt to taste and lots of freshly ground pepper. Top with a bit more cheese and serve immediately.

## Pasta with Eggplant and Tomato
- FOR TWO
- $5 TOTAL $2.50 / SERVING

This is similar to a traditional pasta alla norma, but without anchovies and ricotta salata. I like to use a tubular pasta for this dish, but you can use anything, even spaghetti. The eggplant and tomatoes come together into a sauce that is thick and jammy and savory.

#### Ingredients

- ½ lb pasta (rigatoni or similar)
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 large eggplant, cubed
- 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- ½ tsp chili flakes
- 2 cups canned tomatoes, finely diced
- ¼ cup Romano or Parmesan, freshly grated
- salt and pepper
- fresh basil, finely chopped (optional)

#### Instructions

Put a pot of water on high heat and add a good shake of salt. Bring it to a boil and cook the pasta according to the package instructions.

While the water is coming to a boil, splash the olive oil into a wide pan on medium-high heat. Let it get hot. Add the eggplant cubes and sprinkle them with salt, then cook for about 5 minutes. If the eggplant starts to look too dry, add a bit of water.

Once the cubes are a little brown on all sides, add the garlic and chili flakes and stir. Add the tomatoes and cook for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Again, if it looks too dry, add a bit of water. Everything will shrink up and become a sort of loose, thick sauce. Add half the cheese and half the basil, if you have it.

Once the pasta is cooked, drain it and add it to the saucepan. Toss everything together, then turn off the heat. Add salt and pepper to taste.

Serve it in bowls sprinkled with more Romano and basil.

## Chana Masala
- FOR TWO
- $3 TOTAL $1.50 / SERVING

This Indian chickpea dish is a staple in my home. If you don’t have cooked chickpeas around, you can use canned, but it will cost about $1 more.

#### Ingredients

- ½ tbsp ghee or ½ tbsp butter plus a splash of olive oil
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- ½ cup onion, diced
- 1 tsp garlic, finely chopped
- 1 tsp ginger root, grated
- ½ jalapeño, finely diced
- 3 tsp coriander powder
- 1 tsp turmeric
- ¼ tsp cayenne powder
- ½ tsp garam masala powder
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- ½ tsp salt
- 1 cup canned tomatoes, puréed
- 2½ cups cooked chickpeas, drained
- ½ cup water

GARNISHES
- fresh cilantro
- yogurt

#### Instructions

Measure out all the spices except the cumin seeds and put them in a small bowl.

Let the ghee (clarified butter) melt in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. (Ghee is the traditional Indian choice, but you can substitute butter and a splash of olive oil if you can’t find ghee.) Once the ghee begins to sizzle, add the cumin seeds and stir for about 5 seconds. Add the onion and sauté for 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the ginger and jalapeño and cook for 1 more minute. Add the spices and then the puréed tomatoes. Mix, then put a lid on the pan and let everything cook down for 5 to 10 minutes.

Once the tomato has reduced and the ghee starts to separate from the sauce, add the chickpeas and water. Mix, then bring it to a boil before reducing to a simmer. Cook for 10 minutes, then squish a few chickpeas with a spoon to thicken the sauce. Garnish with yogurt and cilantro. For a full meal, serve over rice or with roti.

## Black-Eyed Peas and Collards
- FOR FOUR
- $5 TOTAL $1.25 / SERVING

This is similar to the southern classic Hoppin’ John. If you have them, you can add more vegetables to the base along with the onion—celery, carrot, bell pepper, and some canned tomato would all be great in this. If you want to skip the bacon, just add smoked paprika to replace the smoky flavor.

#### Ingredients

- 1 cup dried black-eyed peas
- 1 tbsp butter 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 3 strips bacon, cut into small pieces
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 large bunch collards
- salt and pepper

#### Instructions

Soak the black-eyed peas overnight in 4 cups of water.

Melt the butter in a large saucepan on medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, bacon, and bay leaf. Cover the pan with a lid and leave it for 2 minutes. Stir occasionally and cook until the onions are translucent and the bacon is starting to be crispy. Drain the peas and pour them into the saucepan. Cover them with water and turn the heat down to medium-low. Cook for 30 minutes to 2 hours. The cooking time will depend on how old the peas are, which is difficult to predict. The peas are done when you can easily squish them on the countertop with the back of a spoon. Check on them every half hour or so, and if water boils off, add more to cover them.

While the peas cook, line up several collards leaves on your cutting board and slice the tough central stem away from the leaves. Discard the stems. Thoroughly wash the collards, then chop them into bite-sized pieces. Alternatively, use your hands to tear the collards into small pieces.

Once the peas are cooked, add the collards to the pot and put the lid back on. Add 1 teaspoon of salt and some freshly ground pepper, then stir. Taste the liquid and peas and add more salt as needed. Cover the pan with a lid and leave for about 10 to 15 minutes. Once the collards are tender, turn off the heat.

Serve this over rice or any other grain, or with some toast or flatbread.

## Vegetable Jambalaya
- FOR SIX
- $3.90 TOTAL $0.65 / SERVING

I don't make jambalaya exactly the way they do down south, but this vegetable-heavy version is faster and just as good--a great, throw-everything-in-the-pot kind of meal. It's spicy, savory and deeply satisfying. The leftovers are great for making burritos or warmed up with a fried egg on top.

#### Ingredients

- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1 green bell pepper, chopped
- 3 stalks celery, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- ½ small green chili, finely chopped
- 2 large tomatoes, chopped
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp cayenne pepper
- ½ tsp dried thyme
- ½ tsp dried oregano
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp pepper
- 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce or soy sauce
- ¾ cup long grain rice
- 3 cups vegetable broth or chicken stock

Additions
- slices of fried sausage
- shrimp
- leftover meat, tofu, or beans

#### Instructions

Start with the oil in a large high-sided saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion, pepper, and celery, then cook for about 5 minutes, until they become translucent but not brown.

Add the rest of the ingredients except for the rice and broth. Let everything cook for about 1 minute to let some of the tomato juice release.

Add the rice and slowly pour in the broth. Reduce the heat to medium and let the dish cook until the rice absorbs all the liquid. It should take about 20 to 25 minutes.

If you’re using any of the additions, throw them in at about the 15-minute mark to let them warm up.

## Filipino Chicken Adobo
- FOR EIGHT
- $10.40 TOTAL $1.30 / SERVING

This ultra-adaptable recipe comes to us care of Tony Pangilinan, who grew up on food stamps after his family immigrated from the Philippines “with nothing but four suitcases and a lot of dreams.” After several decades of struggling to achieve those dreams, Tony can now help support family members who remain in poverty in the Philippines. Despite their hard circumstances, he notes that his relatives “still feel blessed.”

Filipino adobo—very different from Spanish adobo—is basically anything cooked in vinegar, soy sauce, and garlic. Although this version is chicken, you can use any meat or vegetables you like. It’s a brilliant dish that turns basic staples into deliciousness. Because it’s vinegar-based, it also keeps well in the fridge!

#### Ingredients

- ¾ cup rice vinegar or white vinegar
- ¼ cup soy sauce
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ tsp black pepper
- 2 bay leaves
- 8 chicken thighs, fat trimmed
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil ¾ cup water
- 2 medium potatoes, chopped
- 4 medium carrots, sliced
- 2 cups white rice
- salt
- 2 tsp cornstarch

ADDITIONS
- 4 jalapeños
- ginger root, grated

VARIATIONS
- 1½ lb pork shoulder or butt, cubed, instead of chicken
- 1 can coconut milk instead of water
- chicken schmaltz instead of vegetable oil

#### Instructions

In a large, non-aluminum pan, stir together the vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, pepper, and bay leaves. Add the chicken, coating each piece thoroughly. Cover and let marinate for at least 30 minutes, but overnight is great.

Pull the chicken out of the marinade and pat each piece dry

Pour the oil into a large pot on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add enough chicken to fill the bottom of the pot. Let it cook for a few minutes, until one side of the chicken is browned, then flip it over. When the first batch of chicken is done, remove it from the pot and repeat with the remainder.

After all the chicken is browned, put it back in the pot along with the marinade, water, potatoes, and carrots. Turn the heat up until the liquid comes to a boil, then reduce to low heat and simmer for 45 minutes, or until the meat near the bone is no longer pink and the carrots and potatoes are cooked through.

About 20 minutes before the adobo is ready, pour the rice into a medium pot with 4 cups of water. Add two pinches of salt. Bring to a boil over medium heat with the lid off. Turn the heat down and cover with a lid that is slightly askew to let the steam escape. Cook about 20 minutes, until the water is all gone.

Remove the bay leaves from the adobo. In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with a tablespoon of water, then stir it into the sauce. Let the sauce boil and thicken until the chicken and vegetables are well glazed. Serve over the rice.

## My Dad's Baked Beans
- FOR TWO, OR FOUR AS A SIDE
- $3 TOTAL $1.50 / SERVING

My dad loves beans in basically any form. This is his formula for the quickest, easiest way to get beans on his plate without missing out on great flavor. Dad’s beans rely on a can of baked beans as the base, while my version uses dried beans you might have left over from another meal. Mine requires a little more cooking and chopping to create the sauce, but comes out even less expensive because of the dried beans. They both taste great, so go with what works best for you: super quick and cheap, or quick and cheaper

#### Ingredients

- 2 cans (27 oz) baked beans
- 2 tbsp mustard
- 2 tbsp molasses or brown sugar
- 2 tsp chipotle en adobo, or any chili sauce

#### Instructions

If you’re using the chipotle en adobo, chop it finely to be sure the spice will be evenly distributed.

Mix all the ingredients into a pot and heat on the stove until the beans are warmed through. Give it a stir and serve. Or do it all in the microwave—works just as well!

Serve with rice, or just in a bowl. For an English-style breakfast, try spreading the beans over toast. Or throw them into a burrito, or scramble them with eggs, or stir-fry with onions and bell pepper.

## My Baked Beans
- FOR TWO, OR FOUR AS A SIDE
- $3 TOTAL $1.50 / SERVING

- 2 tsp chipotle en adobo,
- or any chili sauce

VARIATONS
- spicy mustard
- no chipotle

TOPPINGS
- salsa
- scallions
- fresh cilantro
- avocado
- tomato
- crumbled bacon
- chunks of ham

#### Instructions

Cook everything in a pot on medium heat for approximately 5 minutes, or until the juices thicken. That’s it!

## Half-Veggie Burgers
- FOR EIGHT
- $7.30 Total $0.90 / SERVING

When a reader named Quinn suggested a recipe that used both lentils and meat, I started thinking about how veggie burgers and beef burgers each have their own strengths. Why not combine the two ideas to create a burger with meaty flavor but the lean protein and low cost of lentils? And so I offer you the half-veggie burger. May it rest a little lighter in your belly

#### Ingredients

- 3 cups lentils or beans, cooked
- 1 cup bell pepper or other vegetable, finely chopped
- 1 lb ground beef or other ground meat
- 1 egg (optional)
- salt and pepper
- 8 buns

#### Instructions

You can use almost any vegetable to make these burger patties, except lettuce and other greens. If you pick a hard vegetable like potato, squash, or eggplant, you’ll need to cook it first.

Roughly mash the lentils. Make sure the vegetables are either small to begin with (like corn or peas) or finely chopped so that they cook evenly. I went for a bell pepper this time.

Mix the lentils, veggies, and meat with your hands in a large bowl. If you’re going to barbecue, add an egg to keep them from crumbling. Season with salt and pepper. Form into 8 patties.

Grill the patties either on the barbecue or a pan on the stovetop over medium-high heat. Sear until dark brown on one side, then flip ’em and do the same on the other side. If you want cheeseburgers, lay cheese on the patties after flipping them once.

Serve on toasted buns with your favorite condiments and fresh vegetables. Burgers are a great place to be adventurous!

If you won’t eat all the burgers at once, wrap the raw patties in plastic. Refrigerate for a few days or freeze for up to 2 weeks.

## Beef Stroganoff
- FOR SIX
- $16.50 TOTAL $2.75 / SERVING

Beef stroganoff is one of my husband’s favorites, so I make it as a treat for him—and one of my early readers, Dave, says his mother made it for him growing up. It’s a classic winter meal from Eastern Europe that warms up a cold house and fills the air with rich aroma. You can use any cut of beef; just adjust the cooking time based on the toughness. Dave’s mom made it with red pepper instead of carrot, so feel free to do the same if you can get red peppers at a good price.

#### Ingredients

- 1 lb beef chuck or other cut
- salt and pepper
- 2 tbsp butter 2 onions, chopped
- 2 large carrots, chopped
- 1 tbsp flour
- 2 tsp paprika
- 4 cups water
- 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 lb mushrooms, chopped
- 1 lb egg noodles
- ½ cup sour cream
- 3 tbsp mustard

ADDITIONS
- ½ cup red wine
- potatoes
- fresh dill

#### Instructions

Chop the raw beef into bite-sized pieces and season generously with salt and pepper.

Melt half the butter in a large saucepan on medium heat. Toss in enough beef to cover the bottom of the pan. You may need to cook the meat in two batches, depending on the size of your pan. Brown the meat on all sides, then set it aside on a plate.

Add the onions and carrots to the pan and cook until the onions become translucent. Sprinkle with the flour and paprika, then cover with water. Drop the meat back in the pot. Cover the pot with a lid, but leave it askew so the steam can escape. Cook on medium-low heat for 2 hours. This process will make the beef tender and turn the water into beef stock.

If you’re using a less tough cut of beef, you don’t need to cook nearly as long. Simply brown the meat, then substitute the water for 1 cup of beef stock and cook for 20 minutes. It’s a lot quicker, but of course tender meat is more expensive!

Meanwhile, in another pan on medium heat, melt the rest of the butter. Add the garlic and cook for about a minute. Add the mushrooms and toss to coat them with garlic and butter. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Let the mushrooms cook about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they brown and shrink. Turn off the heat and taste. Add salt and pepper as needed.

Cook the noodles (or any pasta) according to the package instructions. Try to time it to coincide with finishing the stew.

Check on the beef. If the water has reduced to approximately a cup of thick, flavorful liquid and the beef is tender, it’s done! If not, let it cook a little longer. Once it’s ready, stir in the mushrooms, sour cream, and mustard. Turn the heat down to low to keep it warm until the pasta is ready. Once again, taste and add more salt, pepper, and paprika if needed.

Put the noodles into bowls and top with the stew. Sprinkle a little paprika over top and enjoy!

## Tofu Hot Pot
- FOR FOUR
- $7.20 TOTAL $1.80 / SERVING

I got really excited when my friend Iva asked for a recipe that featured the Chinese flavors she grew up with. After all, Chinese cooking depends on the same general principles as Good and Cheap: build bright flavors from a few key ingredients; use lots of veggies and just a little meat or fish. The ginger-garlic broth in this hot pot is spectacular! You can use whatever vegetables you have around, but mushrooms help create an earthy broth. The effect of such a small amount of toasted sesame oil is remarkable, too—an investment, but a transformative flavor.

#### Ingredients

- 1 tbsp ginger root, finely grated
- 4 cloves garlic, finely grated
- 8 cups water
- ½ lb mushrooms, chopped
- 1 tsp chili paste
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tsp toasted sesame oil
- 4 scallions, chopped
- 16 oz firm tofu
- 4 medium carrots, chopped
- 8 oz dried spaghetti, soba, or any Asian noodles
- bean sprouts (optional)

ADDITIONS
-  chicken, pork, or beef
- peanuts, chopped
- cabbage, chopped
- kimchi
- chili peppers
- fresh cilantro
- daikon radish, sliced

#### Instructions

If you have time, freeze the ginger root for an hour before you start. It’s much easier to grate when frozen! Store the rest of the root in the freezer until the next time you need it.

Drop the grated ginger root and garlic into a pot over medium heat. A few seconds later, once you can start to smell the garlic, pour in the water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low.

Add the mushrooms, chili paste, soy sauce, and toasted sesame oil. Place a lid on the pot and let simmer for 20 minutes.

Separate the white and green parts of the scallions. You’ll cook the white and save the green to sprinkle over the soup.

Cut the tofu into four slices, then turn each slice into eight squares. Or just chop it up however you like.

Add the tofu, carrots, and the white parts of the scallions to the broth. Cook about 10 minutes more, until the carrots are tender.

Add the noodles and keep boiling until they soften, usually just a few minutes, although it depends on the type of noodles.

Taste the broth. If it isn’t salty enough, splash in more soy sauce. Adjust the sesame oil and chili paste to your taste as well.

Ladle the soup into bowls. For a little crunch, top with bean sprouts and the green bits of the scallions.

If you have leftovers, you’ll find you like this soup even more the next day. Overnight, the flavors will infuse into the tofu, as well as combining with each other. You might want to store the noodles separately, though, because otherwise they’ll get soggy

## Deconstructed Cabbage Rolls
- FOR SIX
- $9.00 TOTAL $1.50 / SERVING

Casseroles are a great way to stretch your cooking-without-a-recipe muscles.  As one reader, Carolie, reminded me, they require little prep time, yield many meals, and the leftovers are easy to store. Casseroles also let you easily tailor an existing recipe to your own tastes. As one reader, Carolie, reminded me, they require little prep time, yield many meals, and the leftovers are easy to store. Casseroles also let you easily tailor an existing recipe to your own tastes.

So here's my adaptation of one of Carolie's favorite casseroles, itself a play on cabbage rolls, a traditional Eastern European dish that is delicious but labor-intensive. This version is a good way to use up leftover rice or grains and lentils including leftover rainbow rice (p. 144).

#### Ingredients

- 1 tbsp butter
- 1 fresh sausage, casing removed
- 1 onion, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 small or ½ large cabbage, cored and chopped
- 3 cups cooked rice (p. 144)
- 4 cups cooked lentils
- 3½ cups canned tomatoes, puréed, or tomato sauce (p. 142)
- salt and pepper

ADDITIONS
- breadcrumbs (p. 146) on top
- olives
- peas or corn
- cheese
- any spice combination (p. 166)

VARIATIONS
- ground beef, turkey, or pork
- instead of lentils and sausage
- swiss chard or collards instead of cabbage

#### Instructions

Heat the oven to 350 °F

Melt the butter in a large pan over medium heat. Slice the casing off the sausage and crumble the raw meat into the pan. I used fresh chorizo because it’s easy to find in my neighborhood and I love the spicy, smoky flavor, but you should use whatever your favorite is. A sweet Italian sausage would taste great too. Sauté the meat until it’s no longer pink, then move it to a large bowl.

Sauté the onion and garlic in the same pan, with the sausage drippings. Once the onion turns translucent, add the cabbage and sauté for 5 to 7 minutes, until tender enough to jab easily with a fork. Season generously with salt and pepper.

While the cabbage cooks, mix the rice and lentils into the sausage bowl. Add salt, pepper, and any other spices you’d like. I’d suggest repeating whatever spices are in the sausage: in the case of chorizo, that was paprika, cumin, and dried chilies, but if you were using Italian sausage, you might add some fennel seeds. Make sure you taste the mixture as you season it. If both parts of the casserole are tasty, you’ll end up with a delicious meal. If they aren’t seasoned well, it’ll be bland.

Lightly oil a large casserole dish. Spread the lentil-rice-sausage mixture into an even layer. Next, spread the cabbage mixture on top. Then, as evenly as possible, pour the puréed tomatoes over top. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Bake until hot and bubbly, approximately 30 minutes.

## Savory Summer Cobbler
- FOR FOUR
- $8 TOTAL $2 / SERVING

Celebrate summer’s most ubiquitous vegetables, tomato and zucchini, with a crunchy Southern biscuit topping.

#### Ingredients

- 3-4 medium zucchini or summer squash, chopped into bite-sized pieces
- 3-4 large tomatoes, canned or fresh, chopped into bite-sized pieces
- 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 4 scallions, finely chopped
- 1 lemon, zested
- ¼ cup fresh basil (optional)
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- salt and pepper

TOPPING
- 1½ cups all-purpose or whole-wheat flour
- ½ cup cornmeal
- 1 tbsp baking powder
- ½ tsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- ½ cup sharp cheddar, grated
- ½ cup butter
- 1 cup milk

#### Instructions

Put the butter for the topping in the freezer for 30 minutes. Set the oven to 425 °F.

Lightly oil an 8” x 10” baking dish (or any baking dish that will accommodate the mixture) and pile in the vegetables, garlic, scallions, lemon zest, and basil. Pour the olive oil, salt, and pepper over top and mix it up with your hands. Bake the vegetables for 25 minutes while you prepare the biscuit topping.

For the topping, measure out the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, pepper, paprika, and cheese into a bowl. Mix it up!

Once the butter is frozen, use a box grater to flake the butter into the flour mixture. Gently massage the butter into the flour with your fingers until it’s crumbly but still clumpy. Add the milk and quickly bring the dough together. Don’t knead the dough: lumpiness is fine and results in flaky topping. Put it in the fridge until the vegetables come out of the oven.

Once the vegetable mixture has cooked for 25 minutes, quickly top it with small clumps of biscuit dough. The vegetables should still be visible in some areas.

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until the vegetables are bubbly and the topping is lightly browned. Top with some more cheddar and some chopped herbs, then enjoy!

For a variation, swap the zucchini for eggplant. Chop the eggplant into bite-sized pieces, salt them, and set them aside for 30 minutes before continuing with the recipe as you would with the zucchini.

## Cauliflower Cheese
- FOR FOUR
- $6.60 TOTAL $1.65 / SERVING

This is a classic side dish in Great Britain: creamy, cheesy sauce over cauliflower, baked in the oven until the edges get crunchy and bubbly. It’s like a healthier and more flavorful version of macaroni and cheese. Alternatively, try this with broccoli or cooked winter squash—everyone will love it.

#### Ingredients

- 1 head cauliflower, cut into bite-sized florets
- 2 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp butter
- 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- ½ tsp chili flakes
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 tbsp all-purpose flour
- 1½ cups milk
- 6 oz sharp cheddar, grated
- salt and pepper

ADDITIONS
-  breadcrumbs (p. 146)
- 1 tbsp Dijon mustard
- 4 scallions, finely chopped
- 1 lemon, zested
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- ½ tsp thyme

#### Instructions

Set the oven to 400 °F.

Bring a large pot of water to boil over high heat. Add the salt and the cauliflower, then leave it for 4 minutes.

Meanwhile, butter a baking dish large enough to comfortably accommodate all the cauliflower. I usually use a pie dish. Drain the water from the cauliflower and pour it into the baking dish.

To make the sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan on medium heat. Add the garlic, chili flakes, and bay leaf, then cook for about 1 minute. Add the flour and stir quickly. The flour-butter mixture is called a roux. You want the roux to get just a little brown; this will probably take another minute. Slowly add the milk to the pot, stirring all the while to incorporate the roux. Bring the sauce to a boil, stirring every now and then to make sure the sauce doesn’t get scorched on the bottom. Once it comes to a boil, turn off the heat and stir in the cheese. Drop in any additions at this point. Taste the sauce and add salt and pepper as needed. You should have a creamy, smooth, savory sauce.

Pour the sauce over the cauliflower. Place the dish in the oven for 40 minutes, or until the top is brown and bubbly. You can also add some breadcrumbs to the top of the dish before baking if you like extra crunch.

Enjoy with a green salad. I also like mine with salsa.

## Vegetable Quiche, Hold the Crust
- FOR FOUR
- $6 TOTAL $1.50 / SERVING

Much as I love this quiche hot, I like it even better cold out of the fridge the next day. It makes a great fast breakfast or lunch. The quiche in the picture uses broccoli, but you can make it with pretty much any kind of vegetable. Some of my favorites are roasted green chilies and cheddar, winter squash with goat cheese, zucchini and tomato, or spinach and olive.

#### Ingredients

- 1 tbsp butter
- 1 large onion, sliced into half moons
- 3-4 cups chopped vegetables
- 8 eggs
- 1 cup milk
- 1 cup cheddar or other cheese, grated
- 1 tsp salt
- ½ tsp black pepper

#### Instructions

Set the oven to 400 °F.

There are two ways to make this quiche. If you have a cast-iron or other oven-proof skillet, you can make the quiche right in the skillet. This cuts down on dishes. Otherwise, start with a regular skillet and later transfer everything to a pie plate to bake.

Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add your onion slices and sprinkle a bit of salt and pepper over them. Cook the onions until they are golden brown and starting to caramelize. If your pan is oven-proof, simply remove it from the heat and spread the onions evenly across the bottom. Otherwise, butter a pie plate and scoop the onions into it, creating an even layer on the bottom. The onions add a crust-like texture and a bit of crunch.

A note on vegetables: For things like broccoli, cauliflower or winter squash, I suggest steaming or cooking them before adding them to the quiche to ensure they’ll be fully cooked. For tomatoes, zucchini, spinach or any other quick-cooking vegetable, just use them fresh.

Spread the vegetables evenly over top of the onions. The ish or pan should look fairly full.

In a bowl, use a fork to lightly beat the eggs with the milk, cheese, salt, and pepper, just enough to break up the yolks and whites. This is a savory custard mixture. Pour the custard over the vegetables and onions and enjoy watching it fill in all the free spaces.

Bake the quiche in the oven for 1 hour. Once the surface is lightly brown all the way across, it’s fully cooked.

Let the quiche cool for about 20 minutes, then slice into wedges and serve with a side salad.

## Shrimp and Grits
- FOR FOUR
- $12 TOTAL $3 / SERVING

The cost of shrimp has jumped sharply since I wrote this recipe, so save this one until you can find a deal—under about $8 per pound. This is far from an authentic Southern version of this dish, but it is absolutely delicious. Southerners will demand you use white stone-ground corn for this, and I won’t quibble, but feel free to use yellow if it doesn’t offend you.

#### Ingredients

GRITS
- 1 cup grits
- 4½ cups vegetable or chicken stock
- ½ cup sharp cheddar, grated
- 3 scallions, finely chopped

TOPPING
- 1 lb shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 1 tbsp butter or vegetable oil
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1 bell pepper, chopped
- 2 sticks celery, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 green chili, finely diced (optional)
- 1 tomato, chopped

#### Instructions

Bring the stock to a boil in a medium-sized pot, then turn the heat down to low and slowly pour in the cornmeal while stirring briskly with a wooden spoon. Stirring while pouring is crucial to keep the grits creamy and smooth—no lumps! Once the grits become smooth and thick, place a lid on the pot with the spoon still in it so that steam can escape.

Let the grits cook while you prepare the rest of the meal, checking in occasionally to give them a stir. The total cooking time should be about 25 to 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, prepare the shrimp and vegetables. Add the butter or oil to a large pan on medium heat and let it get hot. Add the onion, pepper, and celery. Sauté until the onion is just translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic, as well as the green chili if you like things spicy. Let everything cook for another minute. Add the tomato and cook for 3 or 4 minutes, until the tomato releases its juice and the vegetables resemble a thick and chunky sauce. Add a dribble of water to keep everything loose and saucy, then toss in the shrimp. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the shrimp are pink all over. Add salt and pepper to taste.

Once the grits are ready, take them off the heat and add the cheese and most of the scallions, then stir. Ladle the grits into bowls and top with the shrimp, vegetables, and a few more scallions.

## Spicy, Crunchy, Creamy Polenta
- FOR TWO
- $3.50 TOTAL $1.75 / SERVING

Polenta plus vegetable plus egg equals satisfying and delicious. You can also add a can of corn to the polenta for deep, rich, corny flavor. Or go a little different by adding frozen peas, scallions, olives, or (my favorite) green chilies to the polenta. Or skip the Romano and add ¼ cup of grated cheddar to the polenta.

#### Ingredients

- ½ cup polenta or cornmeal
- 2 cups water
- ½ tsp salt
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 4 cups fresh spinach or 1 cup frozen
- spinach, roughly chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 anchovy, finely chopped (optional)
- ½ tsp chili flakes (or fresh chili)
- 2 eggs
- Romano or Parmesan, freshly grated
- salt and pepper

#### Instructions

Bring the water and salt to a boil in a medium-sized pot, then turn the heat down to low and slowly pour in the polenta while stirring briskly with a wooden spoon. Stirring while pouring is crucial to keep the polenta creamy and smooth—no lumps! Once the cornmeal becomes smooth and thick, place a lid on the pot with the spoon still in it so that steam can escape.

Let the polenta cook while you prepare the rest of the meal, checking in occasionally to give it a stir. The total cooking time should be about 25 to 30 minutes, but if you’re in a rush, you can eat it after 15.

Meanwhile, chop the spinach, garlic, and anchovy if you’re using it. Set them aside. Add a bit of olive oil or butter to a pan on medium heat. Let the pan heat up until it sizzles when you flick it with water. Add the garlic, anchovy, and chili flakes. Let them cook until you can smell them, about 1 minute. Add the spinach and toss it around with a spoon or tongs, or just swirl the pan to coat the spinach with the garlic mixture. Let everything cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until the spinach is wilted. Remove the pan from the heat and move its contents to a bowl to wait for the polenta and eggs.

When the polenta is about 2 minutes from done, start with the eggs. Wipe the pan quickly with a cloth, then put it back on medium heat. Splash a bit more olive oil in the pan and wait for it to get hot. Crack the two eggs into the pan and cover with a lid. This will steam them, making sunny-side-up eggs with fully cooked whites.

Scoop the polenta into a pair of bowls. Add some Romano and lots of salt and pepper. Layer about half the vegetables over the polenta.

Once the whites of the eggs are cooked, remove them from the pan with a spatula and lay them over the polenta and vegetables. Top with the rest of the vegetables and further sprinklings of cheese.

## Roast Chicken
- FOR SIX
- $8 - $15 TOTAL $1.50 - $2.75 / SERVING

A whole chicken is usually less expensive than buying single pieces like breasts or thighs—plus you can make stock later from the bones and any meat too difficult to get off. The leftovers can be used in sandwiches, tacos, over a salad, or tossed with sauce and mixed into pasta. This is a base recipe: add spices to the butter or sprinkle over the surface of the chicken to change up the flavor in any way you like.

#### Ingredients

- 1 whole chicken
- 1 tbsp butter
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 lemon
- salt and pepper

#### Instructions

Heat the oven to 400 °F.

Remove the giblets and neck from the chicken. Keep them for stock later. Rub the entire bird with butter, then sprinkle it with salt and pepper.

Smash the garlic cloves with the side of your knife and slice the lemon in half. Stuff the garlic and lemon into the chicken’s body cavity.

Place the chicken in a roasting pan or an oven-proof skillet. Let it cook for 1 hour. If you have a meat thermometer, check to make sure the chicken is at 165 °F, the temperature when chicken is completely safe to eat. But 1 hour should be long enough to fully cook it.

Let the chicken rest for at least 10 minutes before you carve it to make sure you don’t lose any of the tasty juices.

After you’ve carved away all the meat, make chicken stock from the carcass. Simmer it for several hours in a pot full of water along with scrap vegetables like the ends of onions and carrots, plus a generous helping of salt.

## METHOD: Roasted Vegetables

When the weather turns cool, I want only to eat warm, flavorful food. Roasting is easy, it warms up the kitchen, and it makes the house smell like the holidays. If you’re uncertain how to prepare a new vegetable, you usually can’t go wrong with roasting—most things end up sweeter, with nice crunchy bits. If you roast a bunch of vegetables at the beginning of the week, you can eat them throughout the week in various ways: with eggs at breakfast, folded into an omelette, as a side dish, in a taco or sandwich, on toast, or with any grain.

#### Ingredients

- vegetables
- olive oil or butter
- salt and pepper

ROOTS
potatoes, sweet potatoes, beets, turnips, onions,
parsnips, carrots, sunchokes, kohlrabi, fennel

NON-ROOTS
bell peppers, winter squash, broccoli, Brussels
sprouts, cauliflower, asparagus, eggplant

EXTRAS
whole garlic cloves (unpeeled), lemon slices or
lemon zest, anything you would pair with roast
chicken, tough herbs like sage, oregano, thyme,
bay leaves, any dry spice combination (p. 166)

#### Instructions

Set the oven to 400 °F.

Clean and chop your vegetables. Generally, I prefer to leave the skin on for the following reasons: skin tastes nice and gets crispy; there’s a lot of nutrition in the skin; peeling is slow! Just be sure to wash the vegetables thoroughly.

It’s up to you how you want to chop your vegetables. Many are nice roasted whole, like new potatoes or little sunchokes or turnips—they will be crispy and salty on the outside and bursting with fluffy, starchy goodness inside. The general rule is that the smaller you chop things, the faster they cook, so try to keep everything about the same size so nothing cooks faster than anything else.

Dump your vegetables into a roasting pan. Drizzle everything with olive oil or melted butter—about 2 tablespoons per medium-sized roasting pan. Season generously with salt and pepper and add any other extras from the list at right. Use your hands to coat the vegetables thoroughly with the oil and spices.

Pop the pan in the oven for 1 hour or longer, but check on the vegetables after 45 minutes. Test them by poking them with a knife. If it meets no resistance, they’re finished; if not, let them cook longer. Don’t worry: it’s not much of a problem if you overcook them. Unlike vegetables overcooked through boiling or steaming, overcooked roasted vegetables may dry out a bit, but still retain their shape and flavor.

After you pull the vegetables out of the oven, push them around with a spatula to free them from the pan. Remove any garlic cloves and smash them into a fine paste (removing the skins at this point), then put the garlic back in the pan and mix together.

Squeeze the juice out of any lemons and discard the woody bits of any cooked herbs. Add a little more butter, a bit of favorite sauce, a little soft cheese or mayonnaise, and serve.

## Roasted Totatoes with Chilies
- FOR FOUR
- $3 TOTAL $0.75 / SERVING

It doesn’t get much simpler or more satisfying than this. You can use any pepper you like—from large, dark poblanos, to Hungarian wax chilies, to bell peppers.

#### Ingredients

- 4 medium potatoes, chopped into bite-sized pieces
- 4 medium chilies, chopped into bite-sized pieces
- 2 cloves garlic, unpeeled
- 1 tbsp butter, melted
- salt and pepper

#### Instructions

In a large roasting pan, tumble together the potatoes, peppers, and garlic. When you chop the peppers, be sure to get rid of the seeds and white placenta inside.

Pour the butter over top and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Potatoes need quite a bit of salt! Use your hands to mix everything up.

Roast for 1 hour, or until you can spear the potatoes easily with a fork and everything is a little crispy. Squish the garlic cloves, discard their skins, and spread the roasted garlic throughout.

In addition to being a great side dish, this makes a delicious taco filling. At left, it’s pictured on a tortilla topped with chopped tomato and queso blanco.

Alternatively, try it alongside some black beans and rice or piled high on a plate with an egg on top.

## Spicy Broiled Tilapia with Lime
- FOR TWO
- $9 TOTAL $4.50 / SERVING

This meal comes together so quickly it’s astonishing. Broiled fish is crispy on the outside and flaky and moist on the inside. If you quickly sauté some vegetables while the fish cooks, dinner will be on the table in minutes.

#### Ingredients

- 2 fillets tilapia or other white fish
- 1 tsp salt
- ½ tsp pepper
- 1 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 tsp cumin powder
- ½ tsp garlic powder
- ½ tsp oregano
- ½ lime, juiced

#### Instructions

Turn your oven’s broiler to high.

Mix the spices together in a small bowl. Sprinkle them over both sides of the fish and massage gently with your fingers to cover thoroughly in the spices.

Lay the fish on a baking pan lined with aluminum foil.

Broil for 4 to 7 minutes. The fish will cook very quickly, so after 4 minutes, check to see if they’re done by gently inserting a butter knife into the thickest part. If it goes through easily and the fish flakes apart, you’re done. If the knife meets resistance and the fish stays together, put the fillets back under the broiler for another few minutes. Once you’ve done this once or twice, you’ll be able to tell when your fish is done at a glance.

When the fish is done, squeeze a lime over it. Serve with rice or a favorite side dish like spicy green beans (p. 59).

# Big Batch

It’s simple economics: usually making a large amount of something is cheaper and more efficient than making lots of different small dishes. You can blow a whole batch all on a big celebration or portion these dishes out and freeze them for later use. You’ll be extremely grateful to your past self when you pull delicious home-made food out of the freezer on a busy Monday evening!

## Spicy Pulled Pork
- FOR TEN
- $14 TOTAL $1.40 / SERVING

Pulled pork is a celebration, worthy of a special day. It’s incredibly flavorful, rich, spicy, and remarkably versatile. Although it seems expensive, it’s quite a bargain when you look at the price per serving. As with most celebratory meals, this one takes quite a long time to prepare. Most of the time, however, is just spent waiting for it to cook “low and slow.”

#### Ingredients

- 5 lb pork shoulder

DRY Rub
- 1/3 cup brown sugar
- 2 tbsp coffee, ground
- 2 tbsp kosher salt
- 4 tsp smoked paprika
- 3 tsp sweet paprika
- 2 tsp cumin powder
- 1 tsp coriander powder
- 1 tsp clove powder
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp black pepper

#### Instructions

Mix the rub ingredients together. Apply liberally to the pork shoulder, pressing it gently into the meat until you’ve covered every side. Set any leftover rub aside for later. Place the pork shoulder in a large pot with a tight lid or a Dutch oven. Cover with a towel or lid and leave in the fridge for a few hours or overnight.

Pour enough water into the pot to cover the bottom. This will keep the juices from burning. Put the lid on and place the pot in a 200 °F oven for 10 to 12 hours. I find it’s easier if I cook the pork overnight and pull it out in the morning, but you can put it in early in the morning and have it ready for dinner as well.

The supposed rule is that cooking takes 1.5 to 2 hours per pound of pork, but I find it usually takes a little longer than that. You are waiting for the internal temperature to reach 200 °F. The meat is edible at 160 °F, but at higher temperatures the tough connective tissues break down to create the flavor and texture that make pulled pork a delicious and unique treat.

If you don’t have a meat thermometer, figuring out the internal temperature is obviously difficult, but you can test it by feel. Poke the meat with a finger: when it’s so soft that it falls apart on its own, take it out of the oven.

To pull the meat, remove it from the juices and gently tear the pork apart with two forks or with your hands. Discard any larger bits of fat that you don’t wish to eat. If any section is hard to tear apart, the meat hasn’t cooked enough to break down the connective tissue. If you have the time to spare, put it back in the oven for another couple of hours.

Once you’ve pulled all of the pork, mix in any remaining rub and move it to a casserole dish or a large plate. If you aren’t eating the meat right away, stash it in the fridge.

Optionally, if you want to make a sauce from the pot full of drippings, bring it to a gentle boil on the stovetop over medium-high heat. Let the juices thicken for 20 to 30 minutes. The fat will rise to the top: it’s the clear, thick layer, not the thin, red liquid below. Skim off as much of the fat as possible. Mix a few spoonfuls of the pan drippings with the pork before serving.

Feel free to add a little barbecue sauce to the pork if it isn’t flavorful enough for you, but try it first—I think you’ll be surprised!

There are a million ways to eat pulled pork, but I like it over squishy hamburger buns or in tacos with crunchy vegetables. Traditionally, pulled pork sandwiches have cabbage slaw on them, but anything crunchy will do. (A diner near my apartment does a great slaw with apple and celery root.)

Don’t forget some veggies on the side to round out the meal—a simple green salad, corn on the cob, steamed green beans, or any other summery vegetable.

## Deviled Eggs
- makes 24 half eggs
- $3.60 total $.15 / half egg

Deviled eggs are my favorite party food and the perfect recipe to dedicate to my friend Camilla. At parties, I often eat too much random junk food and end up feeling gross. These eggs are a great antidote: festive and delicious without being empty calories. Although they’re a little fussy, they aren’t actually difficult to make. I’ll start you off with these few ideas, but you can add whatever flavors suit your fancy.

#### Ingredients

- 12 eggs
- salt and pepper
- 2 scallions, finely chopped (optional)
- paprika (optional)

CLASSIC
- 2 tbsp mustard
- 2 tbsp mayonnaise
- 2 tbsp water, pickle juice, or lemon juice

CHILI AND LIME
- 2 tbsp mayonnaise
- 2 tbsp lime juice
- 1 jalepeño, finely chopped

CURRIED
- 2 tbsp mayonnaise
- 2 tbsp water
- 4 tsp curry powder or 1 tsp each of tumeric, cayenne, coriander, and cumin

RAMEN-INSPIRED
- 2 tbsp mayonnaise
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp cup [sic] rice vinegar
- chili sauce

TOMATO
- 2 tbsp mayonnaise
- 1/4 cup fresh or canned tomato, finely chopped, or tomato sauce (p. 142)

CHORIZO
- 2 tbsp mayonnaise
- 2 tbsp fresh chorizo, cooked
- 1 tsp paprika

VARIATIONS
- any spice combination (p. 166)
- any vegetable, finely chopped
- green chili and cheese
- feta and fresh dill
- bacon
- avocado
- olives

#### Instructions

Hard-boiled eggs are easier to peel if the eggs aren’t quite fresh, so try making these when you have eggs that have been sitting around for a week or two.

Place a layer of eggs at the bottom of a pot that is large enough to fit them with a bit of wiggle room. If you can’t fit all your eggs, don’t stack them—they might crack. Split them into batches instead.

Cover the eggs with cold water. Bring the pot to a boil over medium heat without a lid. As soon as the water is boiling, turn off the heat and cover the pot with a tight lid. Set a timer for 10 minutes.

When the timer goes off, gently pour out the hot water and cover the eggs with very cold water. The cold water stops the cooking process so that you don’t end up with that slightly icky blue-green skin around your yolk.

Peel the eggs. Everyone has their own technique, but I like to gently roll each egg across the counter to crack the shell. Roll the egg around until it looks like a cracked desert landscape, then peel it starting from the bottom. Once peeled, rinse the egg and set it aside. Repeat until you have peeled all the eggs.

Slice each egg in half lengthwise. Pop the yolks out and put them in a medium bowl. Don’t worry if you leave a little yolk behind. Set the whites aside on a plate.

Sprinkle the yolks with salt and pepper, then add other ingredients of your choice to the bowl. Mash with a fork and mix until it becomes a relatively smooth paste.

Arrange the whites on a plate and spoon the yolk mixture back into each hole. Pile the filling high! Alternatively, scoop the filling into a plastic sandwich bag. Cut off the corner of the sandwich bag and squeeze the yolk mixture into the whites.

Sprinkle with the scallions and some paprika for color. Have a great party!

## Perogies
- MAKES SIXTY TO SEVENTY-TWO
- $14 TOTAL $.20 / PEROGY

This is a huge recipe that will feed you for days. It takes time and effort, but the results are worth it. The most fun approach is to invite a couple of friends over for a perogy- making party. Everyone takes home a bag or two for the freezer, and it’s a great time!

#### Ingredients

DOUGH
- 4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tsp salt
- 2 cups yogurt or sour cream
- 2 eggs
- 1 tbsp water, as needed

FILLING
- 5 Russet potatoes, roughly cubed
- 1 1/2 cups sharp cheddar, shredded
- salt and pepper

ADDITIONS
- 2 tbsp scallions, chopped
- 4 cloves roasted garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp Dijon mustard
- 1 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 tsp paprika

TO SERVE
- sour cream
- scallions, chopped

#### Instructions

In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt. Pour in the yogurt, eggs, and a tablespoon of water. Mix it slowly and carefully. The dough will be quite sticky. Cover it with a towel or plastic wrap while you make the filling.

Put the chopped potatoes in a pot and cover with water, then add a bit of salt. Cover with a lid and bring to a boil over medium-high heat before removing the lid. Let the potatoes cook until tender, about 20 minutes. Test them with a fork: if it goes through easily, they’re done.

Drain the potatoes and add shredded cheese, salt, pepper, and any additions you might enjoy. I like strong aged cheese because you don’t have to use as much. I usually use several additions, and you should play around with some of your favorite things—there aren’t many flavors that don’t work in potatoes! Next, mash the potatoes with an electric mixer or just two forks. Once the filling is ready, gather some friends because shaping takes some time!

Flour your countertop liberally. Split the dough in half. Keep one half covered, but place the other half on the floured surface. Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough, about 1⁄4” thick. Punch out as many 3” to 4” dough circles as possible, using a round cookie cutter or a drinking glass. Squish the scraps into the remaining covered half of the dough.

Drop about a tablespoon of filling in the center of one circle of dough. Fold the dough over the filling and press the edges to create a dumpling. The stickiness should ensure a tight seal. Lay the dumpling on a floured surface and use a fork to squish the edges together. Repeat until you run out of circles, then repeat everything with the remaining dough.

Once you have all your perogies formed, boil a pot of water and add about 12 perogies. Let them cook until they rise to the top, about1 minute. Pull out the boiled perogies with a spoon, then repeat with the remainder in the same pot of water.

If you’re planning to freeze some of the perogies, let them cool down and then put them in freezer bags with the air squeezed out. I usually do 12 to a bag, but you can portion them out in whatever way suits you. They will keep for at least 6 months in the freezer.

You can eat the perogies just boiled, but if you’re anything like my family, you’ll prefer them fried afterwards. Melt a tablespoon of butter in a pan on medium heat, then fry up as many perogies as you want. (Six per person is plenty.) Flip them every few minutes until they’re browned on all sides. Serve with scallions and a dollop of sour cream.

## Dumplings
- MAKES SIXTY
- $7.20 TOTAL $0.12 / DUMPLING

My friend Raffaella comes from a huge family and fondly recalls making dumplings with her sisters growing up. (Her brothers just ate them.) Dumplings are a great way to use up veggies that don’t look fresh anymore. Minced inside a dumpling, they come back to life! I’ve provided a couple of ideas here, but as with so many recipes, the filling is up to you. If you mess up and it comes out bland, just dip the dumpling in soy sauce or chili sauce and you’ll still be happy.

#### Ingredients

DOUGH
- 4 cups flour
- salt
- 2 eggs
- 1 cup water

VEGGIE FILLING
- 3 cups broccoli, finely chopped
- 2 cups carrot, grated
- 8oz firm tofu, crumbled
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp toasted sesame oil
- 2 scallions, chopped
- 2 eggs

PORK FILLING
- 1 lb ground pork or sausage, cooked or raw
- 3 cups collards, chard, spinach, or scallions, finely chopped
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp toasted sesame oil
- 2 scallions, chopped
- 2 eggs

ADDITIONS
- ginger root, grated
- garlic

#### Instructions

To save time, see whether your grocery store has pre-made dumpling wrappers, usually in the freezer section or Asian aisle. They come round or square and might be called gyoza or wonton wrappers, but any will work.

If you’re making your own dumpling dough, add the flour and salt to a large bowl. Make a crater in the middle and crack in the eggs along with the water. Use one hand like a shovel to mix the dough into a shaggy mass. If it seems too dry, add water a few drops at a time. Knead the dough for a minute, then cover it with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it rest for 30 minutes to 2 hours.

Choose one filling or the other. Mix all the filling ingredients in a large bowl.

Once the dough has rested, split it into four chunks. Dust your countertop with flour, then roll the first piece of dough into a log. Leave the other pieces covered so that they don’t dry out.

Cut the log into 15 equal slices, then use your hands to form one of the slices into a flat disc. With a rolling pin, flatten the disc into an almost paper-thin circle about the size of a drink coaster.

Place a heaping tablespoon of filling in the center of the dough. Lift all the edges to meet in the middle, then pinch it closed like a little parcel. If the dough won’t stick to itself, wet your fingertips and dab the edges.

Repeat until you run out of either filling or dough. This is a great time to ask for help from family or friends—one person rolling while others fill and cook.

Now, a tough decision: do you want to steam, fry, or boil your dumplings?

To steam them, spread a small amount of oil around a large pan. Fill the pan with dumplings—as many as you can fit without them sticking to each other. Turn the heat to medium and let them sizzle for about a minute. Once the dough has absorbed most of the oil, add about 1⁄2 cup of water to the pan, then quickly cover with a lid. The water will splatter and sizzle loudly. Leave the lid on for about a minute to steam the dumplings, then turn the heat down to low and remove the lid. Let it keep cooking until the water evaporates, then turn off the heat. Your dumplings should be steamed on top with crispy, brown bottoms.

To pan-fry them instead, start following the technique above, but use more oil. Skip the water and the lid entirely. Just keep frying! Once the dumplings are golden on one side, flip them to fry the other side. This method is awkward with parcel-style dumplings but works well for other shapes, so plan accordingly.

Alternatively, boil the dumplings by dropping them into a pot of boiling water. When they rise to the top, they’re ready to eat, usually in 1 or 2 minutes.
